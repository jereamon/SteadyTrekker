I just filled up my journal yesterday. I started it a year and a half ago, initially with the sole intention of bettering my cursive handwriting. Along the way I found writing to be a beneficial way to stay organised and focused.

I think we can agree, it's good to have goals. Setting and working towards goals provides purpose and continual growth. As you gain confidence and set your sights higher your goals will likely become more complex and less clear in the short term.

In my journaling I wasn't putting conscious effort towards organizing and simplifying the goals I'd set for myself. They came up in my writing because they matter to me and became easier to understand through my freeform exploration of what I want to accomplish and what I may need to do to get there.

To this point, as far as journaling goes, I've found this to be my preferred approach. I have other more logical methods for intentional organization, but I enjoy having the time set aside to let my mind roam.

So in my opinion, yes, journaling will likely help you achieve your goals. It helps me simplify, and hold on to ideas that might have otherwise slipped away.
