About 40 weeks ago I decided to set out on a book journey. Determined to read more and with the intention of setting a lofty goal for myself I decided to shoot for 52 books in 52 weeks.

I'm quite a ways in to my goal and keeping up well. I managed to get a few books ahead for a while but find myself just keeping pace now.

You definitely have to pick and choose what you're going to read when you're trying to finish each book in a week. With only so much time to read each day too long of a book or to high of a reading level can slow you down enough to make finishing in time impossible.

I don't want to miss out on books because they're a tough read or have a large number of pages. Instead I've managed to offset slow reading books with very quick ones. I'll read something massive, like <a href="https://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/buy.asp">The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss</a>, that might take a week and a half to read and offset it with something like <a href="http://www.redwallabbey.com">Mattimeo, by Brian Jacques,</a> that can be finished in a few days.

Along the way I've also found audio books to be invaluable. Allowing me to continue with my 'reading' while doing my necessary everyday mundane tasks. Additionally with audio books a slight increase in playback speed. Say from 1.0x to 1.20x, a barely noticeable difference audibly, can shave 10 hours off a 55 hour audio book, like <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-stormlight-archive/oathbringer/">Oathbringer, by Brandon Sanderson</a>.

So now that I'm 40 weeks in I can't help but feel like I'm on the home stretch. Well on my way though still with three months of reading to go. Anything could happen between now and then, but I'm feeling confident given my track record thus far.

Hopefully this gives you some ideas for books to read and motivation to set aside some time to read them. It's easier than you think to find extra time in your schedule, no matter how full it feels. Instead of picking up your smartphone, turning on the tv, or watching that last YouTube video, set it all aside and reach for a mentally stimulating, deeply engrossing, impossible to set down book!
