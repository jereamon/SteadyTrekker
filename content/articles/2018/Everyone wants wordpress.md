But seriously, I'm quite new to this field as anything other than a hobby and as I try to land my first freelance client it has become abundantly clear that everyone wants Wordpress.

I don't have anything against Wordpress. It's just that I was having so much fun in my own little world writing sites from scratch and feeling good about myself a<img class="size-medium wp-image-5 alignleft" style="font-size: 1rem;" src="/images/article_images/2018/04/do-more-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><span style="font-size: 1rem;">s they ca</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">me to life from nothing but the lines in my code editor.</span>

Now, as I try to monetize the skills I've developed I can't help but feel as though my freedom has been infringed upon by this overarching CMS. Forcing me to do things a certain way. In all likelihoodÂ the right way...

Still, I'll push through and stick with the hope that as my knowledge and client base grows I'll discover that what started out feeling restrictive might set me free. Until then child themes and template tags will haunt my dreams.
