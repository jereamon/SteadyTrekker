This is a test more than anything. I know I can publish a blog post from my phone. But I want to know just how much of my actual work day can be done from my lovely mobile device.

I've had this dream for quite a while now of being able to work from anywhere. I'm well on my way, making at least small amounts of money working remotely. But when I say anywhere I mean anywhere.

Of course it's not good enough to be able to work from home. My goal is to be able to work from a coffee shop, cabin, van, or side of the mountain.

What would hold me back from that at this point? Electricity and internet access. The good news is there's still a lot you can get done without internet. Enough to keep busy for a few days until you get a connection and can implement changes or upload creations.

The good news is cell phone connection is becoming more reliable every day and comparatively my cell phone battery lasts quite a bit longer than my laptop.

Hence the test. Just how much work can I get done on my phone. My phone can handle all my communication needs, allows me to hunt for new contracts and clients, draft blog posts, continually learn, and make minor modifications to my WordPress sites.

So, I might have to rule out working from the side of a mountain since most of these require a cell connection. But when it comes down to it I think the answer is clear.

Depending on what you do for a living you can get a lot of work done right from your phone.
