I've been a road trip fiend for a few years and now that I'm beginning to get some work doing basic web development I've become a little obsessed with the idea of going on extended trips and being able to work from the van the entire time. My road trip setup is pretty basic. Really I'm car camping. Not so glamorous as the many people who live around here and have fancy motorhomes or $80,000 conversion vans. What I have has worked so far but I would love some upgrades. Just something simple. Like the ability to keep my phone, computer, and maybe some lights charged. Unfortunately the more I look into it the less simple it appears. I'm having a hell of a time figuring out how many battery backup amp hours I'll need, how powerful of an inverter, and how many watts of solar to keep it all topped off.

I've learned that the more you discharge your batteries the faster they'll wear out. Meaning that ideally, you'd never drop below 80% of a full charge. Even 50% discharge will drastically shorten their life. So, for optimal operation, if you need 20 amp hours per day to run awesome LED lights, you would want to have a 100ah battery so that you're never depleting it more than 20%. This drives the cost up quickly. Especially when you need a whole lot more than 20ah/day to power something like a computer. Stacked on top of this is the inherent loss in the system from things like inefficient charge controllers or potentially even more inefficient inverters. It's enough to make your head spin, and enough to make me consider not even dealing with it. On the flipside though, working from anywhere, from the comfort of your vehicle/home seems to tip the scales enough to keep me looking into it. There's only one other glaring problem to solve.

An unavoidable necessity for anyone making their living as a web developer.Â There is still a lot you can get done without the internet. A lack of internet access doesn't necessarily mean an absolute lack of productivity. But in the end, you have to upload your work and make changes to the live version of your site somehow. You might be quietly saying, 'duh, go to a coffee shop, library, mcdonalds, etcetera.' I, on the other hand, would prefer to avoid cities whenever possible. This is beneficial for my mental well being but not so beneficial for consistent internet access. Hence my deep dive into the world of mobile broadband. Essentially cell phone plans that allow you a large quantity of data usage. At home with the capability of unlimited usage, I find myself consuming around 100 gigabytes in thirty days. I figure if I cut out all extraneous youtube videos, online video games, and general interesting but unnecessary web browsing I could probably cut that number in half. But still, 50 gigabytes of data from a cell provider doesn't come cheap.

For anyone wondering, the best deals I've found thus far are from Project Fi, who allows unlimited data/talk/text for $80/month, but does slow your speeds down after 15gb unless you opt to continue paying $10/gb for high-speed data. And Sprint, which appears to offer a mobile broadband connection plan with 50gb of data for $55/month. Either way, they're not outrageously expensive, but still, cost quite a lot considering the limitations in speed and total usage compared to having unlimited data on a dedicated connection at home. There will always be tradeoffs. I'm still doing my research and trying to decide what my work best for me.
