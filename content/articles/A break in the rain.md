Alright, I'm learning this WordPress bullshit. I just added my first custom CSS that actually worked. It's such a complex hierarchy that somehow pieces together to show you this page.

Anyways. I'm excited! We get a break in the rain! It looks like just one day, but better than nothing right? The gorgeÂ gets a little bleak come early spring when you're feeling trapped indoors. I said screw it, and went for a hike yesterday anyways. Another trip up Wind Mountain! I love it up there. Even when there's no view it's still fun to spend some time in a cloud on what looks like the edge of an endless cliff. There's a spot I've noticed every time I do this hike . A little spur that you have to hike down to. I've never gone down to it until yesterday. It's well worth it! If you're hiking wind mountain and come to a sharp right corner with a small brushy trail heading off to the left take the time to wander down it! There's a great view and bolts in place for rappelling, if you're into that.
