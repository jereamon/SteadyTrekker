post-title: Dog Mountain Snow Hike
---

After a stretch of excellent weather to start March, a forecast with snow crept up on us and delivered as the weather service predicted with a couple of inches falling overnight and heavy snow continuing on through the morning.

I decided to head out into it to tackle the steep and challenging trail that leads to the top of Dog Mountain. When I walked out the door the snow was still falling so it was a bit surprising to find five other cars already in the parking lot when I arrived.

Getting the final bits of my gear together only took a moment and then I was back on a familiar trail trying to keep the snow off the camera strapped to my chest. I seem to say this for every hike, but this one starts out steep and stays steep.

The trail began clear of snow but that didn't last for long. It began as a dusting and soon became a couple of inches. Fortunately, the trail is wide, well maintained, and cemented in my memory so even being covered by snow it was still easy to follow.

For those who haven't tackled this hike, it begins with many switchbacks taking you far above the highway below before cresting a ridge and leveling out for the briefest moment where there is the option to take the hard route or the harder route.

The main difference between the two routes is that the hard route isn't quite as steep, though it does add a bit of additional distance. My preference is to take the steeper route on the way up and the other on the way down.

There's always a little part of me that regrets taking the steeper route once it really gets going but it's usually not long before I find my rhythm and the trail begins to melt away behind me. On this occasion, I even managed to talk myself into stopping for a moment to pull out the tripod and capture a few self-portraits in the glorious snowy forest.

Several photos later and I continued making my way up the trail. As the two separate routes get closer to reconvening there are a few corners that always fool me into thinking I'm closer to the top than I really am. Eventually, though I arrived at the junction and took a moment to get a drink of water.

The trail keeps going up and up through massive fir trees and on this day the snow continued getting deeper as I climbed. There's a corner near the top that always stands out to me. A sharp right where the trail doubles back on itself and abruptly transitions from fir forest to dense and closely grown shrubby brush.

It only takes a short while to pass through the dense shrubs and then the trail opens up for the first time into an open field. Later in the spring this field would be filled with glorious wildflowers, today however, the snow was getting deeper and the wind beginning to gust.

Up to now I had hiked in light clothing, regular pants, a t-shirt over a base layer, beanie, and thin gloves. I stopped to put on more appropriate layers before I totally froze. Especially since I knew from previous experience that a short way ahead I would be fully exposed to the frigid wind.

With my snow pants and jacket on I kept hiking. The snow had blown in deep from across the hill and over the ridge in drifts up to my knees. Trudging on I quickly reached the flat windblown space where a fire lookout once stood. Despite the deepening snow this spot had been scoured by the wind to reveal the rocks below.

A little ways further and the clouds actually began to open up, providing somewhat obscured but still stellar views of Wind Mountain in the distance, the Columbia River below, and base of the snowy hills climbing out of the Gorge in Oregon.

I took a few photos of this scene before my fingers went completely numb and then decided it was time to throw on the rest of the cold weather gear stashed in my backpack. Ducking under a frozen tree for shelter I put on my balaclava, heavy gloves, and goggles. When I stepped back out from beneath the tree the clouds had parted again and the yellow lenses in my ski goggles gave the landscape a merry glow.

The last climb of the hike proved to be the most difficult. Despite intermittent signs of earlier hikers their tracks had been almost completely erased and pressing on through knee-deep snow was slow going.

I passed familiar landmarks and rounded the second to last switchback. Knowing from experience that the few hundred feet left would be easy going. I began marvel at the snow and ice-encrusted landscape surrounding me. There's something otherworldly and majestic about the frozen windblown trees perched atop dog mountain in the winter.

Upon attaining the summit I immediately took shelter under a wonderful small fir tree that had been transformed by the weather to resemble an igloo. Despite making multiple stops for water and rest during the ascent I was feeling exhausted and knew that I would need a proper break to make it back down safely.

Out with the snacks and frigid bottle of water as I sat in growing awe of the places our feet can take us. I didn't rest long before getting up to take a few photos and prepare for the way back.

In the short time since I had gone up the trail, the gusty wind had filled in my tracks and blown-in even more snow. Descending through the exposed field just below the top of dog mountain I now forded knee to waist deep snow and watched the views of the  Gorge improve as the clouds continued to clear.

The deep snow only lasted a short while and abated promptly when I reentered the fir forest that makes up the majority of this trail. To my surprise, the trail was quite busy on the way down with those I saw hiking up ranging in preparedness from tennis shoes and jeans to full snow gear. I greeted those I passed with friendly encouragement still feeling elated at the success and splendor of this late winter day.
