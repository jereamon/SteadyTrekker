I'm starting to feel more prepared for the upcoming adventures I'm planning! What a change from the panic I felt the day I booked my first plane ticket.

For Nepal I've put together a tentative day by day plan for the trek I'm most looking forward to, found a variety of places to visit in and around Kathmandu, and booked a hotel for my first few nights.

For New Zealand, I bought a used touring bike that came with panniers, have been going for road rides near home and went on an overnight trip to Trout Lake Creek Campground.

As well I've been gearing up at a prodigious rate in the hope I'll have time to familiarize myself with new gear before embarking with it in foreign countries. I've purchased a tent, sleeping pad, sunglasses, battery pack, down quilt, and a ton of 700c innertubes.

It's a bit painful watching my bank account fall so quickly but with every new item that appears the excitement mounts. My departure date feels so soon and so far away at the same time. I don't think I'll ever feel fully prepared but I can't wait to wander off into the unknown to find new faces in a plethora of new places.
