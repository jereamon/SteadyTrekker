# Round Trip: 5 miles Elevation Gain: 1500'

This hike begins just east of Lyle, Washington from a non-descript gravel parking lot. The trail begins to climb immediately. With my first steps I passed next to a towering basalt cliff and only a few minutes walk later found myself above it. I continued switch-backing up the steep hill past additional walls of crumbling stone and through talus fields. The trail leveled out just long enough to catch my breath and followed what must have been an old road bed for a ways. Shortly thereafter the trail forks where one could continue on level ground following the old road bed but to get to the cherry orchard you have to turn right and continue to climb.

I did just that and wound my way up the hill as the pillars of basalt I had passed initially began to look small below me. Before long though the climb mellowed out again and allowed for a brief reprieve at the edge of a large plateau. Though it was plain to see that the actual trail continued off to the right, up and away, I noticed a worn in footpath that headed further out onto the plateau.

I had done this hike before but hadn't wandered my way out to the cliff's edge previously and decided this was as good a time as any. Despite being completely overcast and gloomy back at my house I had driven just far enough east for this hike that the clouds were breaking up a bit. The partly cloudy sky made for excellent lighting over town of Lyle and the Columbia River below. And yes, despite the t-shirt I'm in, this is actually the first week of January.

After getting my photos I meandered back to the main trail. Already content with the vista I had reached it slipped my mind that I still had a considerable climb left in front of me. Lost in thought I hopped back on the actual trail and took off at a brisk pace up the trail slowing down only when I realized how sweaty and out of breath I was. I took a moment to take a look around and couldn't help but marvel at the extraordinary place I've grown up and lived my life in.

The clouds roiled and flew past overhead parting just enough for glorious rays of light to shine through and illuminate various portions of the tumultuous landscape that makes up the Columbia River Gorge. Of all the places I've visited there aren't many that are able to evoke the same emotions that the grandeur of this region does.

Further up the trail I crested the ridge that had just looked so far away and remembered now just how far there still was to go. Once it has climbed high enough the trail levels out considerably but continues to wind along the hillside for at least another mile before reaching the end of the trail. I put one foot in front of the other and made my weary way through gullies and endless oak trees.

The nondescript dirt path eventually took me where I wanted to go and as I broke out of the oak trees the gorge came back into full view. I had just received a new toy for my camera that morning, a remote shutter release. It's intended mainly for simplifying the process of taking self portraits. Eliminating the need to set a ten second timer and run back and forth between the camera and cliff edges where I like to pose. However, this new toy also functions as an intervalometer, allowing me to set a timer and take a picture at intervals for the eventual creation of gorgeous time lapses.

I set up my camera and sat down to wait. The thirty eight minutes my intervalometer was set to run for passed quickly. I wandered around, played some hacky sack, and bumped my camera a bit as I scrambled to protect if from a passing rain squall. The result of my efforts adds some motion to the view from near the end of the Lyle Cherry Orchard hike. Oh, and yes, I coordinated the barges to cruise by on cue. Don't ask me how.
