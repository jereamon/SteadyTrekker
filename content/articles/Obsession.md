So how about you? Do you ever get utterly obsessed with things? I find it's often unsolvable problems for me. That and tv shows... But really, the recent one for me is the case of the leaky bike suspension.<img class="alignright wp-image-45 size-medium" src="/images/article_images/2018/04/neonbrand-358352-unsplash-300x195.jpg" alt="A cluttered workshop." width="300" height="195" />

The front fork on my mountain bike has a bit of an oil leak. Being dissatisfied with the answers I received when visiting the local bike shop I set out to find more satisfactory ones online. It turns out that the internet is a black hole when it comes to in-depth bike suspension information. There's a plethora of info about basic maintenance and all the fancy features the new releases will come with. But little to know info about the complex internals or how to service them. I can't handle not knowing. Being unable to find a quick definitive answer my initial curiosity has blossomed to full-blown obsession. I can't find an answer and I can't stop looking for one. It feels so strange to be unable to track down precise detailed mechanical information on the internet. For once I'll actually be reaching out to people! My barrage of phone calls on the local shops begins at ten. The moment they open.
