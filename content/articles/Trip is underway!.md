Oh boy, I'm in San Francisco international airport. I've made it this far but my journey is far from over. After a five hour layover I get to hop on a lengthy flight to China. The duration of which is still uncertain.

My app claims the flight will last 18 hours and 35 minutes. This seems unbearable and a little bit insane. Especially since the longest flight in the world is currently 9000 miles and involves 18 hours and 5 minutes of airtime.

From some quick googling I learned that the route my flight will take is only 7200 miles and the plane I'll be on cruises at a speed of 550 miles per hour. Or about 13 hours flight time.

So the real question is who's right in this case? The excellent high tech app that automatically calculates this information for thousands of flights a day, or me. The google wizard.

Luckily we only have to wait another four hours to find out. And then, oh boy, somewhere between thirteen and eighteen hours in a confined metal tube with the lingering fear that my checked bag won't turn up where it's supposed to.

If I don't sound excited about this it's because I'm not. I finally realized, while trying to fall asleep last night, that the vast majority of my stress is coming from the air travel required to get to my destination.

Once on the ground in Nepal I have a place to stay, things to do and see, an adventurous fun plan. But first I have to endure the tedium and discomfort of getting there.

That's all for now. I'll be back, likely more exhausted, but hopefully more upbeat as I get nearer to my destination.
