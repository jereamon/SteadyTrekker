What are you supposed to do when you want to quit working towards a goal you've expended an enormous amount of time and effort on? Probably just quit, or write about it. You never know it might help.

I don't actually have any idea what you should do. But I've found myself in a position where I've put a ton of time towards a somewhat vague goal. We're talking months and hundreds of hours. And I have very little physically to show for it.

It's all knowledge and computer files. I haven't met a bunch of people and ingratiated myself in a community or produced any fantastic work to hang on the wall.

After all my effort I have almost no ties to my craft. And I want to quit, just give up and forget I ever started. I don't know where to go next, I don't know who to ask, and it's starting to feel like I'm wasting my time. Like it has all been a waste of time.

So I'm hoping that writing about it here will help me analyze the whole situation and maybe reinvigorate my desire to push through the burnout to new heights of productivity. We'll see.

What I know for sure, is that I've put in too much effort to stop. Whether I take a break, or focus on something else for a while I know there's no going back.
