# New Website
It has been quite some time but I've finally gotten around to making a new website on which to post my musings and keep track of the outdoor adventures I go on.

For anyone wondering, I've decided to build this site using the Python based static site generator Pelican. That means I don't have to deal with backend programming and can focus on frontend development and writing. Better yet I can easily write my posts using Markdown syntax.

And if none of that makes sense to you don't worry. It doesn't really matter. My plan for this site is still to post the photos I take and write about the places I visit. Not talk about the technical details of my website.

For now this is all. But hopefully I'll be back with more soon!
I plan to bring the posts from my old website to this one over time but it's a tedious process to change the file paths for all the images so we'll see when I get around to that.
