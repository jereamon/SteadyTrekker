      <p>Well I've done it now. I went and bought a one way ticket to Nepal. My plan is to go from here to Nepal to New Zealand and back home. I've only bought the Nepal ticket for now while I determine costs of living in New Zealand and figure out how long to stay in Nepal.</p>

My flight leaves September 25th, giving me four months to plan and buy the supplies I need. I might need a bit more than your average traveler. The plan at this point is to spend most of my time in Nepal trekking in the Himalayas and nearly my entire time in New Zealand touring via bicycle.</p>
<p>We'll see if that plan changes between now and then. The New Zealand portion hinges on how much money I can earn before then. I'd like to rent or buy a van and explore that way but that would drastically increase the overall cost compared to travelling by the power of my own two legs.</p>

I haven't told anyone I've bought a plane ticket yet. Literally no one. It's not that I'm trying to keep it a secret, just that I'd rather have it be entirely my own decision. I'm thinking I'll wait just a bit longer, let it settle in with me a bit more before I get swayed by other peoples opinions.</p>
<p>That's all for now, I'm excited and nervous and will definitely be writing more about this in the coming months.</p>
