<p>Who would have thought? Here I was assuming that the plethora of satellites in orbit would have allowed for comprehensive elevation and distance data to be gathered across the entire world. I was thoroughly mistaken.</p>
<p>In planning the routes for my upcoming treks I wanted to have an idea of the mileage and elevation gain and loss I would experience I would experience each day. Using the apps <a href="https://maps.me/">MAPS.ME</a> and <a href="https://www.gaiagps.com/">Gaia GPS</a> I was able to calculate what I thought were fairly accurate estimations in the Khumbu/Everest region. Moving to the Annapurna region the numbers my apps put out varied drastically from the guidebook I planned my initial route from.</p>
<p>For example, a day from the guidebook states 640m (2099') ascent and 80m (262') descent. Compared to the <a href="https://maps.me/">MAPS.ME</a> app quoting a combined gain and loss of 6821', over 2000m. There's a high likelihood that I'm misinterpreting one or the other source. And my assumption, for the time being, is that the mapping apps using GPS is taking into account every foot of gain and loss along the way, hopefully overinflating the end result by being too accurate. I have absolutely no idea if that's the case or if that's even possible.</p>
<p>To top it off, my two apps of choice disagree with each other as well.</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshots the routes look very similar. The difference is at the bottom where they state the mileage and elevation change. On the left, Gaia GPS claims 9.1 miles and 5062 feet versus MAPS.ME on the right with 8.3 miles and 6821 feet. My speculation with the difference in elevation is that Gaia only reports elevation gain while MAPS.ME reports combined gain and loss.Â Regardless, I'll continue to use and compare all the tools at my disposal and look further into GPS inaccuracy in remote areas of foreign countries.</p>
<p>To some, my day by day planning may seem to be over the top. And to some extent it likely is. These are well-traveled trekking circuits and there will be many other people on them. However, I'm thinking the better my planning is the easier it will be to improvise while en route and will make it more likely that I can pull off two lengthy treks in one visit without a hired guide for either.</p>
<p>That and thorough planning seems to alleviate some of the anxiety I feel about wandering around in such a foreign and likely uncomfortable place at high altitudes for weeks on end.</p>
