      <h3><br>Well, here I am.</h3>
<p>Back in the gorge and trying to figure out what is next. I took a break from writing after what felt like a writing marathon finishing my Nepal posts. A lot happened between the time I finished trekking and now, but trying to write a post for every day of my trek took longer than I expected so nothing was written for more recent events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I'll be trying to get into a more regular schedule with my content, shooting for one post per week every Sunday. We'll see how that holds up but writing seems to be something I enjoy enough to be worth putting at least that much effort into it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1229} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1229" src="/images/article_images/2019/01/DSC00267-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C680" alt="" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>House sitting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>January has been a mellow month for me. I've been house sitting for a few weeks and spending a lot of time hiding out by the fire. It hasn't been time wasted. I began a Python programming certificate course and got to experience the wonder of living in a house that connects directly to local trails.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It's unreal how easy it is to get outside for a while when you can hike from your house to a view like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1225} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1225" src="/static/images/2019/01/DSC00314.jpg?fit=1024%2C681" alt="" /><figcaption>Looking east down the gorge</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>Goals</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The next month likely be more of the same as I hunt for jobs and web development contracts. Weather and avalanche risk permitting I'll be trying to summit Mount St. Helens this coming Tuesday. One of my goals this year is to climb Mt St. Helens, the South Sister, and Mt. Shasta and I've been feeling antsy to get started on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The conditions have been ideal with low avalanche risk and reasonably warm temperatures but I don't think the furry friends I'm taking care of have kept me from heading out there. Now, of course, wet weather and snow in the forecast so we'll see how my date gets moved around but Tuesday is the plan for now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1224} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1224" src="/static/images/2019/01/DSC00294.jpg?fit=1024%2C576" alt="" /><figcaption>Near the top of the Syncline</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>The best way</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>to the top of Mt St. Helens in the winter is via the worm flows route. Approximately 9.7 miles round trip with 5,577 feet of elevation gain to reach a height of 8,363 feet it's no walk in the park. Fortunately multiple climbs up Mt.Adams and my recent trekking in Nepal have me feeling pretty confident in my ability to cover that much ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The bad news is that I won't be doing this climb with skis. I'm expecting snow from start to finish and while touring gear would make the descent a whole lot faster and more fun I don't have the setup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1226} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1226" src="/static/images/2019/01/DSC00195.jpg?fit=1024%2C680" alt="" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>Well, that's inaccurate.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>as it so happens I do have the whole setup. Boots, skis, skins... It just turns out that in buying this gear used that the boots are a hare too small. I thought toes touching the end would mean a performance fit and would be alright but around two hours into my first outing and my right foot began to cramp up followed a short while later by my left foot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So, my plan is to rent snowshoes from a local shop and hope that I'm lucky with the weather and get to walk on hard packed snow the whole way up. I'm not really sure what to expect and all the more excited for it because of that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1227} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1227" src="/static/images/2019/01/DSC00362.jpg?fit=1024%2C680" alt="" /><figcaption>This sunrise was unbelievable. This one is zoomed way in.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:image {"id":1228} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1228" src="/static/images/2019/01/DSC00341.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024" alt="" /><figcaption>This one is zoomed out.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That's about all for now. The pictures strewn throughout this post are ones from around the gorge that I've taken since getting home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>Update!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I'm going to leave what I've already written for this post, however, the day after I wrote it I decided to post an ad in search of boots on our local classifieds. Twenty minutes later I had a response from someone with a pair in my size, twenty four hours later I was the proud owner of another new pair of used ski boots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So I'm ready! I've got the gear and the willpower but as these pieces have fit into place the forecast has deteriorated. With snow on the <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">way</g> chances of making it up St.Helens on Tuesday are looking slim. But I'll be out testing gear and practicing technique rain or shine. Just somewhere with less avalanche risk.</p>
