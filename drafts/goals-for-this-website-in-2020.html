<p>post_title: Goals For This Website in 2020</p>
<hr>
<h1>What I would like to achieve</h1>
<p>I don't expect this website to see any large growth, nor do I expect it to make me any money. I do however enjoy hiking, writing, and photography and I would like to continue improving and learning about each while hopefully building the skills to make money from one or all of these hobbies sometime in the future. To continue improving I've set a goal for myself and this website this year.</p>
<p>I'm aiming for fifty two hikes, one each week this year and thirty trip reports from those hikes to be posted here throughout the year. To get to fifty-two hikes I anticipate doing some of the same ones several times and I don't want to keep writing trip reports for the same trails. So, fifty-two hikes and only thirty posts. As well, I'm a little late in coming up with this goal, as in, I came up with it this morning. And now that morning, when I started this post, was a week ago. Luckily when I began writing this I was already on track for 52 hikes this year since I had gone on a couple the previous weekend and would go on one later that same day.</p>
<p>Since I've only just come up with this goal I have no plan yet for how to achieve it this post is really just me considering what accomplishing it would require and how to get started. And now, a week later there has been some consideration for completing this endeavor. </p>
<h2>What I'll need</h2>
<p>To be successful, a list of thirty or so hikes is in order. Thirty-ish good hikes that are accomplishable, within my travel radius, and highly scenic. Because even if I'm willing to traipse around off-trail for miles with the speculative hope of finding a nice view, I don't think that will make for the best photos or story...</p>
<p>As well as a list of hikes I'll need some sort of schedule to fall back on. At this time hiking on Saturday, writing and editing the post and photos throughout the week, and posting the post on Friday sounds good. So if you find yourself irrationally excited to follow along with my outings keep an eye out for new content every other Friday.</p>
<p>And if anyone is reading this, I would love recommendations for hikes, ideally in the Pacific Northwest but we'll see how the year pans out and whether or not I can make some trips further afield for worthy outings. And if you would like to come along don't hesitate to get in touch! At the time of this writing, I have a contact form on the home page through which you can reach out. And if you're reading this sometime down the road and that contact form is gone look around on my site, I should have left contact info somewhere on there!</p>
<h2>What can you expect?</h2>
<p>To summarize what you may expect to see here as the year progresses, as stated above, anticipate trip reports from my hikes. These will include photos and a linear written account of each of the hikes I go on. We'll see how much time this alone takes to accomplish. I'm making no promises as of yet, but I would like to write and release other content as well. Other content would primarily be helpful advice revolving around fun outdoor pursuits. Things like, take a piece of a closed-cell foam pad with you to sit on when you go hiking in the winter to keep from freezing your butt off when you stop for a break! But I'm open to suggestions for content ideas as well!</p>
<p>And finally, I'm making a list of hikes below though I think before long that list will have a dedicated page for itself. So look forward to that. Or don't, either way I'm going to make it.</p>
