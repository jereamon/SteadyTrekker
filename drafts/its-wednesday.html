      <p>Does anyone else get stressed about sudden changes in their life? Even when those changes are positive and they want them? I love and despise the schedule I stick to. I want toÂ be flexible and constantly adapting to new and wonderful scenarios but, when it comes down to it, I always develop some kind of habitual pattern and in many ways, I think that's entirely necessary. I find it very difficult to break away from those patterns once I've been ingrained in them <img class="size-medium wp-image-13 alignright" src="/images/article_images/2018/04/simon-migaj-432653-unsplash-e1522856988133-300x252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" />for a while. I had thought it would get easier every time. My experiences haven't reflected that thought though. It seems to be just as difficult to break free regardless of how unhappy I feel with my current habitual patterns.</p>
<p>Somehow someday perhaps I'll find a way to straddle the line between perfect order and utter chaos. All the while maintaining a high level of motivation and productivity. For the time being it's a difficult shift. A worthwhile one. I can't hide away from the world forever, but it sure is nice to take a break from it.</p>
