<h2><span>Elevation Gain: 1800'</span> <span>Summit: 4780'</span></h2>
<p>I wasn't entirely sure if we would even make it to the trailhead let alone up the trail on this little adventure. Trip reports are few and far between this time of year, especially on a less popular hike like Little Huckleberry mountain. I checked the nearby Snotel and ski resorts reports and managed to find on the Forest Service website the tidbit that the road we would take had several inches of snow on it. The Forest Service report was several days old and recent warm weather left me thinking that perhaps the trailhead would be approachable.</p>
<p>I threw a couple of shovels in the car along with my hiking gear and my mom and I set off. It's always pleasant driving out into the deep woods and this day was no different. The skies were clearing up after a long week of dense grey clouds and rain and I couldn't help but be optimistic about our chances of successfully summitting this small peak.</p>

<p>At least until we reached Willard and began seeing snow along and on the road. We were only twenty minutes from home and somewhere around 1200 feet in elevation. I began to worry that driving clear up to 2900 feet may not be as likely as I had thought. Regardless, we continued, finding snow on the road in places as well as long stretches of bare pavement. We slipped around corners and plowed through slush, slowly ticking off the intervening miles.</p>
<p><img alt="Closeup of the trailhead sign" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04225.jpg"></p>
<p>Until the trailhead came into sight that is. It felt sudden, as though there ought to be further to go. But we had both hiked this trail several times and weren't about to drive past the familiar turnout today. I pulled off the road hoping we wouldn't sink immediately into deep and unforgiving snow and was surprised to have no problems pulling up to park directly in front of the trailhead. The snow was only a few inches deep and was compacted and still crusty on top despite the unseasonably warm morning temperatures.</p>
<p><img alt="The easy section of this trail doesn't last long" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04229.jpg"></p>
<p>We laced up our boots and put on our gloves. It wasn't freezing outside, but was certainly cold enough to keep our layers on as we started hiking. The trail starts out easy wandering into the forest, but it doesn't stay that way for long. After only a couple of minutes the climb begins and once it does it continues for some time.</p>
<p><img alt="The climb begins." src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04231.jpg"></p>
<p>We made our slow way up and up through an endless field of huckleberry bushes and large second growth trees. Based on the reports I was expecting snow the whole way, yet surprisingly, it was patchy at best. Short sections were covered but by and large we hiked along on dirt, even as we steadily gained elevation.</p>
<p><img alt="A downed log blocks part of the trail." src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04240.jpg"></p>
<p>After around a half mile this trail gets steep. Well, most of the trail is steep, but this short portion is very steep. The pace slowed to a crawl, my calves began to burn, and I used the excuse of having to pee to step off the trail for a break.</p>
<p><img alt="The steepest part of the trail" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04244.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="Lovely bits of moss on a tree" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04248.jpg"></p>
<p>Before too much longer our momentum carried us up and over a ridge and we found ourselves on nearly level trail. A short jaunt later on this easy walking path we spotted the tree with a broken and barely legible one mile marker sign. Only one and a half to go now.</p>
<p><img alt="Flat section of trail." src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04251.jpg"></p>
<p>Leading up to and for a ways after the one mile marker the trail meanders along the side of a steep hill. It remains around the same elevation and a good twenty feet over a short descent. It frustrates me to no end having to lose any elevation after all the effort getting up there takes. But, of course, we kept going and after the small dip got returned to our status quo climbing ever upward.</p>
<p><img alt="The easy hiking goes on for a little while" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04252.jpg"></p>
<p>Now again, several inches of snow covered the trail and continued on at least as far as we could see. We made our way up and up under logs and through small creeks before reaching the two mile marker where, abruptly, the snow ended again. Fog blew up the steep hillside around us reducing visibility to fifty feet and giving the forest the feeling of an ethereal plane, where you can't help but assume a bear will come lumbering along at any moment to eat you for a wintry dinner. Maybe it's only me who gets that feeling though.</p>
<p><img alt="Closeup of some more lovely moss" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04256.jpg"></p>
<p>And maybe it was from the exertion of hiking but it didn't feel that cold out. The rapidly altering conditions flung us back out of the snow onto dirt and the trees let loose a barrage of frigid raindrops, nearly refreshing if not for the shivers they induced. This all felt odd considering we had nearly reached 4700 feet in elevation and it was the middle of December.</p>
<p><img alt="Nearing the top of the mountain!" src="/media\images\2019\12\DSC04285.jpg"></p>
<p>The last half mile drug on. We had each completed this hike before and as we drew nearer to the end the foggy trail played tricks on our perception. Several times we rounded corners and believed them to be the last. Finally we did find the top. Our arrival was somewhat underwhelming. The summit usually provides fantastic views of Mount Adams and Mount Saint Helens and, in turn, gives an extraordinary perspective of the overwhelming size of the surrounding wilderness. Today, there was fog.</p>
<p><img alt="My mom and I with nothing but fog behind us" src="/media/images/2019/12/DSC04295.jpg"></p>
<p>There was snow on the ground at the top as well as the final remnants of an old fire lookout, four short concrete pillars. Being clear of snow the pillars made for excellent, if firm, stools. We set our bags down and immediately went for the snacks we had stashed inside. The forecast had been for a cloudy morning after days of warm storms, with a clear afternoon. So we waited.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes we had caught several glimpses of the surrounding countryside through the fast moving far off clouds and fog rolling up over our mountain perch. We gave it another ten minutes and were rewarded with a glimpse of one corner of the snow covered Mt.Adams to the northeast. Another ten minutes and we had sun beaming down on us with a nearly clear view in all directions.</p>

<p>A difficult hike certainly feels more worthwhile when it culminates with an expansive view of rolling forest punctuated by familiar landmarks and the occasional volcano. Our spirits were high and getting back down went quickly. We didn't even have to dig the car out to get back on the road. In retrospect it almost felt too easy. I guess we'll have to try it again now that another storm has blown through.</p>
