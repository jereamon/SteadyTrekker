      <p>Yes, that's right, I've made it to Nepal! My home for the next forty days. Even though it's only my parents reading this I'll elaborate. I'll be in Kathmandu for five days before flying to Lukla to start my trek. I anticipate twenty-four days of trekking, though this is just guesstimation and not by any means an exact itinerary. After wandering around in the mountains I should have somewhere around eleven to fourteen days left in Nepal. I'll initially return to Kathmandu but I'm already a bit tired of the big city and thinking that I'll probably make the journey to Pokhara for the rest of my stay. If I get done trekking in the Everest region much sooner than expected I may try to go for a trek in the Annapurna region.</p>
<p>For the time being, I'm finding the last pieces of gear I need to be prepared for high altitude exploration and sightseeing in Kathmandu. The stupa's and temples are fantastic but I'm already sick of being approached by so many 'guides' and aspiring artists. After one evening and morning of walking around Thamel, I've had my fill of enterprising Nepali's telling me how good of friends we are only to try and shanghai me into paying them for some inane, unagreed to service. I have a feeling I'll be a much more assertive person by the time I leave here. Everyone is extremely persistent and I've quickly discovered you can spend inordinate amounts of time trying to wheedle your way out of purchasing something you never asked for if you don't quickly say no, goodbye, and walk away regardless of the protests that will undoubtedly be thrown your way.</p>
<p>I haven't made it to any of the big sightseeing destinations yet, opting to simply explore the nearby city and get a feel for what's available nearby and simply enjoying navigating traffic and other pedestrians. In the next few days, I'll visit the Monkey Temple (Swayambhunath), wander Kathmandu Durbar Square, Pashupatinath, and several other famous sites. Yep yep, I'm going full tourist. Who knows if I'll ever return here, might as well see everything I can.</p>
<p>And I have already seen some very cool sights. One of them being Kathesimbhu stupa. Only a five minute walk from my hotel and has no entry fee this is a small site comparatively but beautiful nonetheless. As far as I know, it was built in the 1600's and is still standing strong despite some damage from the earthquake.</p>

<p>As well as successfully navigating the streets of Kathmandu on foot I've also managed to consume three massive and delicious Nepali meals without any ill will from my stomach. This is a good trend I hope to keep going. If there's one thing I hope to do while in Nepal it's avoid serious illness. Before leaving I continually read about abhorrent sickness caused by tainted water or underprepared food. Of course, it's a different story once you're on the ground and hungry. There's no easy way to tell whether a cook has properly cleaned their hands or cooking utensils. So I'll eat where the food smells good and enjoy it all the while.</p>
<p>So I'll check back in soon. I don't have that much to say yet. Mainly because I'm still incredibly jet lagged and just doing my best not to fall asleep as I write this. I'm excited, a bit overwhelmed, and not sure if it was a good idea to organize a forty day stay. I hope the weather stays good for my trekking and ideally I won't piss off any Nepali's too much by constantly refusing their service and artwork.</p>
