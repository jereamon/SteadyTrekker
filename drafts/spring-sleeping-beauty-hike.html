<p>post-title: May Sleeping Beauty Hike</p>
<hr>
<p>With all the trail closures I've fallen way behind on my hike per week for the year. With good weather and the news that some trailheads may be opening again soon, I decided to jump the gun and head out on my motorcycle for the Sleeping Beauty trailhead. With a roundabout route planned consisting entirely of remote forest roads.</p>
<p><img alt="I need to replace this but am clearing the warnings I get for not having 'alts'" src="/media/images/2020/05/DSC00711.jpg"></p>
<p>I'd ridden a few of the roads on my route before but wasn't sure whether the snow would be melted off enough to let me get over several low passes and all the way out to the trailhead. Riding along, periodically checking the route on my phone it quickly became apparent this route would take considerably longer than the usual drive. I had expected the gravel roads to double what is typically around a fifty-minute drive but after an hour of riding, I sat in the middle of the woods with a lovely view of Mount Adams and a map showing me a little under halfway to my destination.</p>
<p><img alt="I need to replace this but am clearing the warnings I get for not having 'alts'" src="/media/images/2020/05/DSC00720.jpg"></p>
<p>A couple of photos and a quick drink of water later I was back on my bike to finish the ride. Eventually, I found snow drifts, a bunch of massive puddles, and an extended stretch of road with deep drainage ruts cut in across it. I steered and slid my way from gravel to pavement and back again before making a final turn and climbing the last stretch of road to the trailhead.</p>

<p>Despite seeing loads of other cars, motorcycles, and travel trailers during my ride but was still surprised to find another car at the trailhead when I arrived. I stashed my motorcycle off the road, threw on my hiking boots, and hit the trail.</p>

<p>It had been a couple of years since I'd hiked this trail but I remembered it well. It's another trail that starts steep and stays steep beginning in a forest of massive fir trees that only seem to grow larger as you ascend the steep hillside. There was no snow for most of the trail but downed trees and debris displayed evidence of the recently receded winter conditions.</p>
<p><img alt="I need to replace this but am clearing the warnings I get for not having 'alts'" src="/media/images/2020/05/DSC00751.jpg"></p>
<p>As I continued switchbacking up the trail patches of snow began to appear on and off the trail. I pressed on enamored by the glorious forest surrounding me especially after many weeks without a proper adventure such as this. Eventually, the trail leveled out, reaching the saddle in the ridge that connects Sleeping Beauty to the hills on its western side. Here the snow became deeper and the patches filled in to cover the trail as far ahead as I could see.</p>

<p>The conditions became treacherous as I began the final ascent and drifts of remaining snow turned the thirty-degree sidehill into a crampon worthy scramble. I kicked in steps and kept a hand in the snow uphill from me remaining aware that the higher I climbed the further I would fall if I slipped and couldn't catch myself. Luckily, with care, I passed through the snowy portion and as the trees fell away near the top of the rock the snow did too.</p>

<p>The final hundred feet were clear and the familiar rocky outcrop stood before me with only a few switchbacks left to climb. As the former site of a fire lookout crews had built the trail to the top by stacking stones in an impressive array to allow access to an otherwise isolated point. I marveled at their handiwork and walked my way to the top of the rock where a light wind blew in from the East and took in the view of the four visible volcanoes in the distance.</p>

<p>To my dismay, no mountain goats were in sight today so I reconciled myself with some food from my packed lunch and set about taking photos of myself and the landscape. Climbing around to find better vantages for my camera I began to feel a little like a mountain goat myself.</p>
<p><img alt="I need to replace this but am clearing the warnings I get for not having 'alts'" src="/media/images/2020/05/DSC00800-3.jpg"></p>
<p>A few photos later I checked the time and realized the day was slipping away. I picked up my backpack and began the descent, carefully choosing my footing to avoid a long fall down the snow-covered slopes. To my surprise, I ran into five other people on my way down the trail and found another car pulling into the parking lot just as I reached the bottom of the trail.</p>

<p>With motorcycle pants and boots back on and my energy waning, I decided to take the most direct route back home. I raced back down the long stretch of gravel that climbs to the trailhead and enjoyed the leisurely pavement cruise back into town.</p>
<p>It had been a couple of months since my last proper wilderness foray and this one definitely left me itching for more. With trailheads reopening and better weather on the way I don't think it will be long before my hiking goals are back on track.</p>
