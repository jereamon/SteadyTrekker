      <p>My night in Gorak Shep drug on and on. I struggled to fall asleep and woke up repeatedly as my body tried to get enough oxygen. Lucky for me we had decided to start the next day quite early. 4 am to be exact. We would try to beat crowds and give ourselves ample time to make it to the top of Kala Pattar for sunrise. Kala Pattar offers great views of Everest and since you're looking to the east the sun will come up behind the tallest mountain in the world. Not great for photographs, but you're much more likely to have a clear, glorious view first thing in the morning. I had prepared everything the night before and just had to drag myself out of my warm cocoon, get dressed, and start hiking.</p>

<p>The morning was frigid. Sanjey had wisely chosen to stay in bed for this one. The rest of our group was staying in a different lodge so I started the morning alone, knowing I would find them somewhere up on the hill. I set out by the light of a headlamp and wandered in the general direction of the trail. I had all my layers on and was shivering, lucky for me it's only a short walk across the dry lakebed and from there the hike goes straight up. It didn't take long for my cold body to warm from all the exertion. It was dark, nothing much to see except for the small patch of ground illuminated by my headlight, other people's headlights in the distance, and millions of stars.</p>

<p>I connected to what seemed to be the main trail up the hill and before long heard familiar voices. I snuck up on my friends and didn't say anything until I was right behind them. We greeted each other and continued struggling up the hillside. I wanted nothing more than to crawl back into my warm bed and sleep for hours. Despite exhaustion from recent days and the early hour, something kept me moving. The sky began to lighten and soon I didn't have to use my headlamp. Soon it was light enough to see our destination. It seemed so much further away than I had pictured. Being able to see again wasn't the enlightening experience you might expect. It left me feeling as though I wasn't making any forward progress. My goal seemed to be always the same distance away. I put my head down and kept walking anyway. When I looked up again I could see people at the top. This reassured me, a part of my mind figured that if they could get there so could I.</p>

<p>When I finally made it to the top it seemed to come suddenly. There was a short tricky section through and over some large rocks and just like that, I was amongst the other summiters. They congratulated me and went back to milling about, trying to keep some feeling in their fingers and toes. I scrambled up the small summit block and sat on top peering about. From where I sat the ground dropped away on three sides in steep cliffs. On the fourth side, I looked down and saw my friends climbing up, not far below. I took photos as best I could but my fingers felt frozen solid after taking just a few so I put my gloves back on and admired the sights a moment longer before climbing back down to the safer area where the other summiters waited for sunrise. By now my toes were fully numb. I had worn every layer I brought but they seemed to do nothing for the frigid temperatures on a clear morning at 18,192 feet.</p>

<p>Once my hands had thawed slightly I took more pictures, repeating this process a few times before giving up and hoping that at least one of my photos would turn out. My friends arrived, freezing as well, and climbed the summit block to see the view from the tippy top. The sun hadn't risen yet, though the sky was very bright. I hadn't been able to feel my toes for nearly twenty minutes and decided to head down, concerned about how quickly they may become frostbitten. I had good hiking boots, but they had no insulation and were far from winter-worthy. I made the descent quickly, cruising down what had been a long slow climb. Partway down I ran into our other friends still on their way up and encouraged them to get to the top. I encouraged everyone I saw to get to the top until the trail became too busy to say something to everyone. Around halfway down I began to get some feeling back in my toes and rejoiced, slowing down my pace a bit to enjoy my extraordinary surroundings.</p>

<p>Sanjey was getting up by the time I got back. Packing things up for another day of hiking. He broke the news that he planned to head straight back to Lukla instead of over the other two passes. I was very sad to hear this news but understood as well. He had originally planned to hike straight up the main trail to Everest Base Camp and only our chance meeting had led him to do the many side trips we had already done. Even having planned for all the additional hiking the side trips would create I was already incredibly worn out. I went to get some breakfast and he followed shortly after. I was already in a somewhat foul mood, between exhaustion, language barriers, and the misguided feeling that everyone in Nepal was out to cheat me out of my money any way they could. I found my spirits degrading further over our somber final meal and while I finished packing my things. I had agreed to set out at a certain time with Trevor that morning but as soon as Sanjey and I were ready we headed out the door.</p>

<p>I had thought I would hike with him a ways that morning. My bad mood took ahold though and when I saw he had fallen a short way behind on the climb out of town I just kept going, thinking that perhaps we would meet up again somewhere down the trail and get a chance to say goodbye. Instead, I spent the morning trying to leave my low spirits behind in a haze of dust, perspiration, and homesickness. I was more distraught than I realized about parting ways with my good friend and hiked on for a long time. I made it to Lobuche but it was still early and passed it by without stopping, then I made it to the split in the trail where I would head either to Pheriche and down the hill, or to Dzonglha and the next pass. I didn't stop there either, squandering my last chance to wait and give Sanjey a proper goodbye. Up the trail a ways, just as Pheriche was coming into view far below me I finally succumbed to my weary legs and sat down for a snack and some water.</p>

<p>I was sad and tired but felt marginally better after all that physical exertion than I had earlier that morning. The rest of the hike I had to go more slowly. On weary legs, I climbed and wound my way around a large hillside on a very narrow trail. The views of Cholatse and Chola Lake along the way were breathtaking. Around noon the village came into view. All that stood between me and Dzonglha was a descent into a large valley and the climb back up the other side. I made short work of it, stopping only briefly to talk to a Nepali man headed the other way to Lobuche. He gave me tips about Cho La pass, the next of the three, and the one I planned to cross the next day. We parted ways and by about one o'clock I reached the village, found a lodge, and settled in to while away the afternoon.</p>

<p>My friends arrived later that afternoon and wound up staying at another lodge, securing rooms before they found me. I was glad to see them and explained how Sanjey had decided to head back down. We spent some time hanging out at their lodge that evening but called it an early night hoping to rise early for another big day. This pass sounded easier than the last but would have trials and tribulations of its own. I paid for wifi and managed to give my dad a call for his birthday that evening. After a brief hello to my sister before she left for work and a long chat with both my parents I headed off to bed. Hoping my body and mind would hold up for what was yet to come.</p>
