      <p>Sorry for taking so long to get this post written. I got a bit lazy about it during my last week in New Zealand. I've made myway back to the U.S. and should be wrapping this story up shortly!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having crossed the second high pass I now only had one to go. First, a rest day was in order. There are a couple of good side trips to do from Gokyo and I would have liked to stay there for two full days but my flight was from Lukla back to Kathmandu was coming up fast and I thought I would be best off getting over the final pass before using up any extra days. For my rest day, I planned to hike to the top of Gokyo Ri. A nearby peak that sits at 17,575 feet and from what I'd heard offered fantastic views of the Ngozumba glacier and Mt. Everest.</p>

First things first though, I took a leisurely morning getting breakfast at our lodge and reading for a while and then wandering the village a bit in search for the bakery with the best deals. There just happen to be three different bakeries in Gokyo. Maybe a bit overkill, but also delicious. I found myself a tasty pastry and a loaf of bread that seemed like it might come in handy for the following days. I headed back to the lodge to drop of my bread and grab a few things for my day hike and then got going. Trevor had already left to hike Gokyo Ri that morning and everyone else was either resting or hiking to the upper Gokyo Lakes. They planned to spend two full days in Gokyo and check the upper lakes and Gokyo Ri off their list while they were there.

As every hike seems to in Nepal, this one set off up a steep hill. I seemed to be developing a cough and between that and my weary legs I moved slowly and took frequent breaks. I still made progress, and as I climbed began to see more of the route for the next pass giving me an idea of what was to come the next day. Partway up I ran into Trevor, already on his way down. He left me with some encouraging words and continued his decent, eager to get back to thicker air.

Eventually, the prayer flags marking the summit came into view. It was still a long ways away but being able to see it spurred me onwards. One step, one breath, and I made my way to the tippy top. The summit of Gokyo Ri is spread out, more of a ridge than a single point. There's some fun additional exploring to be done along that ridge, scrambling over boulders and under strings of prayer flags to find a comfy seat out of the wind to rest for a while. I found such a spot and admired the views, looking back the way we had come, down the glacier, past the village of Dragnag, up the valley we had descended, and saw Mt.Everest. From this vantage point, it definitely looked like the tallest mountain in the world, its pointy top sitting far above the other mountains surrounding it. I was lucky the clouds hadn't filled in yet as it was already afternoon.

I didn't want to move or even think, so I didn't for a while. This would be my last side trip on this trek and while I was so ready to be done with all of it I also never wanted to leave. Looking out at the mountains surrounding me I knew I would be back. Maybe not the Solukhumbu next time, but I'll find my way back to the Nepal Himalayas. After setting that intention at the top of a mountain I drug myself back to my feet to make the descent. On my way back to the main trail I overheard some other English speakers. I don't remember now how I started talking to them but I wound up meeting Kathryn and a couple friends she was trekking with.

They were about ready to head down the hill as well and we wound up talking for most of the descent. She was volunteering with the Peace Corps and happened to have some good advice for resources to look into as I progressed as a web developer. She was heading the opposite direction over the passes so after reaching the bottom of the hill we parted ways. Back at the lodge, I took a nap, wrote, read, and wound up meeting a couple of other Americans in the dining room playing cribbage. They invited me to play with them and after a couple of games decided to head up for a nap themselves. I went back to whiling away the afternoon and did so for another hour or so before my friends returned.

We spent the rest of the day just hanging out. Resting up and enjoying each others company. I would be leaving them the next day, hoping to get over the last pass, Renjo La, without incident and have a day to spare before my flight on the other side of it. I knew that nearly the entire way back to Lukla would be downhill after the pass but figured it would take me a while to cover the miles with how worn out my body seemed to have become.
