      <p>I heard many estimates for the time it would take to trek from Phaplu to Lukla. I was told two days by several people as well as three to five days by others. Three to five days is accurate. As I write this I've walked three full days and likely could make it to Lukla tomorrow though we'll be bypassing it to head straight for Cheplung and higher up.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Only 28 miles separate Phaplu and Lukla but high passes and deep valleys make for challenging days up and down slippery stone steps. Expect to ascend and descend multiple thousands of feet each day.</p>

<p>To get back to our original itineraries Sanjay and I hiked from Phaplu to Taksindu, to Karikhola, to Pouiya, to Phakding.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To elaborate, Phaplu resides right around 8000 feet. A comfortable starting elevation and a nice little town that will give you your first views of snow-capped peaks if the weather is clear.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Leaving the town on foot we walked on a road for nearly seven miles. Winding our way in and out of valleys as we slowly climbed towards the trail coming from Jiri.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Shortly after connecting to the trail from Jiri we arrived at Ringmu. Rain threatened and we went back and forth deciding whether to push our luck or stay dry in the lodges at Ringmu.</p>

<p>The drizzle that had begun quickly abated and we began the steep climb to Taksindu La. Our first pass sitting around 10,000 feet. Arriving at this pass on our first day was an exhausting but gratifying moment. It felt as though our trek had really begun.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Our original hope was to continue down a massive descent past the village of Taksindu to Nuthalla or beyond. However, as our weary feet carried us into Taksindu, already 500 feet lower than the pass, we discovered a beautiful monastery perched there and in the end made the decision to stop to visit it.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We found fantastic accommodations nearby in a newer lodge with an all-wood interior and spacious rooms. Relieved and ecstatic we unpacked our belongings and made the short walk back up to the monastery.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to me it turns out Buddhist monks are happy to have visitors and welcome you to sit in on their evening prayer chant. We arrived shortly after they began and stuck around for the full forty five minute session as they chanted, played drums, cymbals, and horns, and filled the room with incense smoke.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We talked briefly with one of them before leaving though in a state of meditative shock I wasn't sure what to ask or say and simply thanked him repeatedly for allowing our participation.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That night we got a taste of a real teahouse. Eating dinner in the communal dining area around a wood stove we met a group all from Australia visiting a school they donate to and picking up trash along their trekking route.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>At the end of the day I was exhausted but so satisfied to be moving. I had no idea how difficult the next few days would turn out to be and slept soundly anticipating a continuation of an excellent adventure.</p>
