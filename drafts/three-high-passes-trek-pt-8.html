      <p>Our disappointing stay in Tengboche didn't last long. We made the best of it, enjoying ourselves playing card games in the smoky dining area and got up early the next morning to continue onwards.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Because of time constraints today we would split from Niclas and Ujjal. Niclas had a flight to catch and barely enough days to make it to base camp and back down. Ujjal had a more flexible schedule but wanted someone to trek with and wasn't going to do the high passes with us. So, they would make the longer walk to Periche that day while Sanjey and I would be left behind along the way. Our plan was to make the hour and a half walk to Pangboche, drop our big bags, and hike to Ama Dablam base camp.</p>

<p>We all set out together in good spirits and made the short walk down out of town through Debuche and back up to Pangboche. Arriving around ten o'clock in the morning turned out to be the perfect way to find a nice place to stay. I asked for rooms at the first couple lodges I saw and emboldened by openings at each I headed straight for the nicest looking place with the best view. Two hundred rupees for the night they told me, and we'd have a view of Ama Dablam from our room. A spacious clean room at that, and friendly proprietors. I accepted and we set about finding lunch.</p>

<p>We wound up eating at our lodge after trying a couple of places around town and not finding reasonable prices or service. Ujjal made fast friends with the owners and we settled in for a long wait for dhal baht. It was great food, but we weren't finished with lunch until nearly an hour and a half later. Niclas and Ujjal had to quickly pack up their things and hit the trail to make it to their destination. We all said goodbye and Sanjey and I watched them head off up the trail. I was tired from our short hike and while sad to see them go I was in no way envious of the ground they still had to cover. After they were gone we had a hiking decision of our own to make.</p>

<p>The plan had been to head up to Ama Dablam base camp the same day we reached Pangboche. Unfortunately, being already after one o'clock at this point, the clouds had rolled in and while visibility wasn't too bad Ama Dablam was completely hidden. Neither of us had much energy or inclination to do a steep hike that would end without any view. Instead, we headed up to our room to read and nap the afternoon away. An afternoon well spent! We were still in the early stages of the trek but already fatigue and homesickness were wearing me down. We had covered so much ground but still had so much left to go. I couldn't help but wonder what I had gotten myself into. I tried to keep myself in the moment, enjoying our afternoon of rest instead of focusing on the days ahead and the distance from home.</p>

<p>The next morning we woke up to clear skies and frigid temperatures. Our breakfast was warm but our bodies were not. This was only the start of freezing mornings but I was not ready for it! Regardless, we made do, packed quickly and set out for Ama Dablam base camp. A difficult hike of 2.5 miles with around 2100 feet of elevation gain. Luckily we were doing it without our big packs. Unluckily, the elevation was becoming severely limiting by this point and the going was slow. I don't think I mentioned already, but Pangboche sits at 13,074 feet making the base camp just over 15,000 feet. The highest I had been before coming to Nepal was on top of Mt.Adams just over 12,200 feet. Today I would leave that number in the dust, in my mind, it would be the first true test for how I would handle the high passes. The lowest of which would still be nearly 2500 feet higher.</p>

<p>The hiking was slow but I felt good. The views steadily grew better as we ascended and my excitement grew as well. There were no crowds, only a few other people for that matter. I hiked in a state of disbelief. Finally surrounded by snowy peaks, without being stuck in a line of people, and I tried to figure out how I had managed to find myself in such a place. The trail felt otherworldly. We had left trees behind, there were just shrubs, grass, rocks, and dust. After an initial steep climb, we came out at the edge of a ravine over one hundred feet deep with a raging glacial stream flowing through the bottom. A bit further and the trail leveled out considerably giving us views of a Mars-like landscape stretching into the distance right to the base of the Mahalangur Himal (the range containing Lhotse and Everest.)</p>

<p>We continued gradually upward and it wasn't long before we crested a ridge and looking into the slight indentation that contains the Ama Dablam Base Camp. I was surprised by how busy it was. I knew Everest Base Camp would be empty because everyone climbs there in the spring. I should have known fall would be good for climbing the lower peaks since the weather is usually clear and not too cold but hadn't thought about it until we found ourselves at a tent city in the middle of nowhere. We wandered around a bit, found a nice place to sit, saw some weird birds, and tried to figure out how anyone could possibly scale such a steep peak.</p>

<p>We made a couple of German friends who had done the high passes in the opposite direction and were on their way down. They both happened to work in tech and had reassuring words for me about starting a career in web development without going to college specifically for it. Thanks, German friends whose names I've forgotten! They also took some great pictures of Sanjey and I together before we left. Thank for that too! Then we began the walk down, running into a talkative woman on her way up, acclimating for a summit attempt in a few days. She seemed to be having too much fun and would have talked our ear off all day but we had places to be and got going before too long.</p>

<p>Our plan was to do the base camp hike, get lunch in Pangboche, and continue up the main trail to Dingboche. We weren't all that hungry when we got down, it was still early, so we purchased some pastries from the nearby bakery, grabbed our bags and got back on the trail. The walk from Pangboche to Dingboche is fairly uneventful though not easy. There's a long stretch of nearly level ground where you can cruise along and catch up to tons of big groups. I had thought they would all head off to Pheriche instead of Dingboche. Pheriche is quite a bit lower and makes for an easier walk that day even if you have to make up the elevation the next. I was dead wrong. We reached the split in the trail where you had to choose between the two villages and everyone took the right to Dingboche. Once again I was stuck in the midst of endless people climbing slowly upwards and did what I do best. Passed them as quickly as I can.</p>

<p>I reached Dingboche and, thinking I was clever, headed for the far end of town based on the assumption that people wouldn't want to walk that far for lodges. I found a room quickly but I was disappointed with the quality and merely set my pack down to keep searching. Everywhere else was full. I couldn't believe it. I had seen tons of people headed towards the village but Dingboche isn't small. There must be at least twenty-five different lodges. I slowly made my way back down through town and ran into Sanjay on his way up. We found a different nicer room near where I ran into him and after dropping his pack went back to grab mine and leave behind the key for the room we wouldn't be taking. The proprietor of the lodge I'd left my bag at was not pleased, telling us not to do that again and stay in separate rooms rather than canceling on one in the future. We were unperturbed, left the key behind, and took off for friendly people to interact with.</p>

<p>We planned to stay in Dingboche two nights so having a nice place to stay was important to us. Our lodge had nice rooms, a nice dining room, and a really cool guy working there who we quickly made friends with. We had another nutritious dinner and got out my travel cribbage board. I had taught Sanjey how to play back in Taksindu and after a quick refresher we played a few games before getting to bed.</p>
