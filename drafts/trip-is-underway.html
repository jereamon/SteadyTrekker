      <p>Oh boy, I'm in San Francisco international airport. I've made it this far but my journey is far from over. After a five hour layover I get to hop on a lengthy flight to China. The duration of which is still uncertain.</p>
<p>My app claims the flight will last 18 hours and 35 minutes. This seems unbearable and a little bit insane. Especially since the longest flight in the world is currently 9000 miles and involves 18 hours and 5 minutes of airtime.</p>
<p>From some quick googling I learned that the route my flight will take is only 7200 miles and the plane I'll be on cruises at a speed of 550 miles per hour. Or about 13 hours flight time.</p>
<p>So the real question is who's right in this case? The excellent high tech app that automatically calculates this information for thousands of flights a day, or me. The google wizard.</p>

<p>Luckily we only have to wait another four hours to find out. And then, oh boy, somewhere between thirteen and eighteen hours in a confined metal tube with the lingering fear that my checked bag won't turn up where it's supposed to.</p>
<p>If I don't sound excited about this it's because I'm not. I finally realized, while trying to fall asleep last night, that the vast majority of my stress is coming from the air travel required to get to my destination.</p>
<p>Once on the ground in Nepal I have a place to stay, things to do and see, an adventurous fun plan. But first I have to endure the tedium and discomfort of getting there.</p>
<p>That's all for now. I'll be back, likely more exhausted, but hopefully more upbeat as I get nearer to my destination.</p>
