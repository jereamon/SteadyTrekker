<h2><span>Elevation Gain: I'm Guessing 412'</span><span>    Distance: Again guessing, 4.7mi</span></h2>
<p>It was raining sideways in White Salmon with no intention of ceasing according to both the weather forecast and the dark clouds outside. I toyed with the idea of heading down the gorge for a short waterfall hike, but to be honest, I've seen all the waterfalls before, yes all of them (haha), and would only be going to get some lovely photos of them. Photos that would be difficult or downright impossible to capture with the temperamental weather raging outside.</p>

<p>I asked my mom's opinion of whether it would be worthwhile to head east instead of west with the hope of leaving the rain behind. She thought it would be worth a shot and even decided to come with. We packed up some basic supplies, tossed the small dog in the car, and got on our way. Consoling ourselves with the notion that even if we didn't escape the rain there would still be open wineries at which to warm up and decompress.</p>

<p>From White Salmon it's twenty five or so minutes to Dallesport and only a few more from there to the Crawford Oaks trailhead. In that short drive we did indeed escape the rain. It actually stopped only a few miles out of town, but we already had a destination in mind and hey, the further from the rain we could get, the better. So we continued driving taking in the familiar, but lovely, sights of the gorge.</p>

<p><strong>For anyone going to hike here be aware that a discovery pass is required and they are available for purchase at the Horsethief Butte parking area nearby though not at the Crawford Oaks trailhead.</strong></p>
<p>We arrived at the trailhead and promptly began hiking out past the information kiosk and up the old gravel road that the trail begins on. The gravel road lead to a corner where a few informative signboards had been placed with a great view looking back towards Horsethief Butte behind them. The informative signboards detail the cause and effect of the glacial floods that shaped the Columbia River Gorge.  Which, for anyone unfamiliar, it may be a good idea to drop this blog post, google Missoula Floods, and delve into the content that arises. These floods make for quite the interesting geological story.</p>

<p>Anyways, we continued beyond this scenic bend in the road and made our way further out into the empty rolling foothills. Eventually, the trail split from the gravel road, turning to the right where the road goes left. Though the trail is technically still on an old road at this point it was now an overgrown dirt road which continued to dwindle away as we made our way along.</p>

<p>After crossing a small creek we found ourselves with a decision of which way to go. My mom had been out here a few times but was interested in trying a different route. We hadn't brought a paper map so technology came to our rescue. If you don't already have it, go download the app Maps.Me. Just be sure you open up the app and download maps for your region before heading out to some remote area without cell service.</p>

<p>I had my maps downloaded on my phone and we took a look at the numerous trails available to be hiked. After brief consideration we decided to take the Old Military Road out to connect with the Vista Loop and then back down the Eightmile Alternate to return to the entry road. Just in case you want to go replicate our day out.</p>

<p>Continuing on our way we climbed a bit too high for our own good. Leading up to this point we had been sheltered by the protective valley we'd hiked up. Now, we were above any protection the valley could offer immediately began to be pummeled by raging winds.</p>
<p><img alt="Trying to walk in a straight line as the wind pummels us." src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05516.jpg"></p>
<p>We struggled to walk in a straight line as gusts of wind repeatedly pushed us right off the trail and made our way over the rolling hills until we connected to the Vista Loop trail and had a nice view looking out east. The Vista Loop trail took us north closer to Dalles Mountain Road and eventually turned west to take us closer to the old Crawford Ranch.</p>

<p>We didn't stop for more than a few moments on this stretch because of the incessant wind chilling us to our bones and even once we made it back down into the valley it was impossible to get warm again. So, with a quick glance at the old ranch we hurried back down along Eightmile Creek connecting again to the Old Military Road, the Entry Road, and arriving shortly after at the shelter of the car.</p>

<p>Just down the road from the Crawford Oaks trailhead is Jacob Williams winery and instead of going straight home we drug our frosty bodies there to enjoy the view of the Columbia River, watch as the rainclouds grew every closer, and warm up with a friendly cat and a glass of wine.</p>
