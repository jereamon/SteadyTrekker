      <p>Today is my fifth day here in Nepal. I can't help but hope the rest are as fun and interesting. I've met a plethora of good people, seen fantastic sights, and learned about Nepal's history.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2018/10/dsc02519408493207556494836.jpg" /></p>
<p>In some regards it feels too easy. For so long I've wanted to visit remote parts of the world and for all those years lived in fear of the unknown. Uncertain whether it was something I could do.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because of the place I've chosen to visit, but so far traveling in Nepal hasn't been altogether more difficult than traveling in the United States.</p>
<p>The people here are friendly and most speak at least a small amount of English, the food is delicious, and it's easy to find anything you may have forgotten at home.</p>
<p>So, no more excuses for me in the future. When there's somewhere I'd like to go it won't be my insecurity that keeps me from going there.</p>

<p>There's a lot of time left in my trip. Plenty of time for things to go horribly wrong. But for now having made it here and survived for the first part of my journey instills me with confidence that I'll be able to cope with anything else that is thrown my way.</p>
<p>I'd just like to say thank you for the warm welcome Nepal. I already hope to return.</p>
