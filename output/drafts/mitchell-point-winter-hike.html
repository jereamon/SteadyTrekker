<p>post_title: Mitchell Point Snow Hike</p>
<hr>
<h2>Rt Distance: <span>2.6mi</span> Elevation Gain: <span>1270'</span></h2>

<p>Mitchell Point is short and sweet. Only a mile or so each way and it provides excellent views and just enough exposure to keep you focused at the top. On this day a couple weeks ago we were having a break in stormy, snowy weather one morning when the clouds opened up enough to show off the scenic sights from the top of Mitchell Point.</p>
<p><img alt="My car parked in a snow covered parking lot." src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05757.jpg"></p>
<p>Despite the forecast indicating additional snow that afternoon beginning at two, I set out for the trailhead at one o'clock in the hope that I could get up there before it began.</p>
<p>The paved parking lot turned out to be an ice rink thinly covered by fresh snow but I slid my way across without breaking any bones and soon found better traction on snow covered dirt.</p>

<p>If you hadn't already taken note of the mileage and elevation gain at the top of this post I'll point it out now by saying this hike is steep. One thousand feet of gain per mile is kind of the sweet spot for a steep climb that shouldn't require the use of your hands. So, in meters, two hundred-ish meters of gain per kilometer? Someone let me know if that's steep!</p>
<p><img alt="A small path up the hill." src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05761.jpg"></p>
<p>Anyways, as with most hikes in the Columbia River Gorge, this one starts going up as soon as you leave the parking lot and doesn't let up till you reach the top. It's a wonderful, albeit noisy, hike as you climb above the freeway and hike past massive fir trees, through scree fields, and make your way up and up out of the mile wide basin that forms the Gorge.</p>

<p>Eventually the trail breaks out of the dense forest and into the cleared area beneath massive powerlines. Fortunately it only remains under these buzzing behemoths for a moment as the trail wraps back on itself to present you with the final ridge.</p>
<p>Ascending this ridge always seems to take longer than I would expect. The top is right there in front of you but it's still steep and partway up gets narrow enough to present you with close up glimpses of sheer cliff just off one side of the trail.</p>
<p><img alt="Big big trees" src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05780.jpg"></p>
<p>On this day when I was there, snow had covered the trail the whole way up. Luckily it was only a few inches deep for most of the hike because I quickly left any other boot tracks behind and pressed on through the untouched snow. </p>
<p>When I broke out of the dense forest to the power lines the oncoming storm had arrived. Clouds and fog reduced what had been clear visibility and snow began to lightly fall. On making it to the final ridge it became apparent that snow had blown in to fill the leeward side as it's depth went from a few inches to calf deep in only a few steps.</p>
<p><img alt="Snow powerlines fade into the distance" src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05787.jpg"></p>
<p>I backtracked slightly and began the laborious process of putting on snow pants, jacket, gloves, and goggles and by the time I finished the snow was falling fast. I took a few final pictures with my big camera before stashing it in the pack to get to the top.</p>
<p><img alt="A distant ridge disappearing into the fog." src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05788.jpg"></p>
<p>I stepped carefully as I approached the summit and reveled in the exhilaration at having sheer cliffs on either side and a winter storm building around me. My layers kept me warm, my goggles let me see, and I managed to take a few quick photos with my phone before it got too wet. </p>
<p><img alt="Looking back down the final ridge." src="/media/images/2020/01/DSC05789.jpg"></p>
<p>Usually this point is somewhere fun to sit, eat lunch, and take in the sights. Today, I didn't linger long, sitting for a moment to look out over the foggy expanse and listen to semi trucks rumble past on the freeway below. </p>
<p><img alt="Looking down off the edge of the cliff" src="/media/images/2020/01/20200115_130652.jpg"></p>
<p>On my way back I plowed through the snow at a half jog, hoping I wouldn't find myself in complete whiteout before making it to the bottom. And as they always do, the hike down went much faster than the hike up. I made it back to the bottom safely and set about defrosting my car for the frightening drive home through worsening storm conditions.</p>

<p>A few final words; don't let the winter weather keep you cooped up! It's too fun to get out and feel the fierce energy mother nature can produce firsthand, even if there's no view when you reach the top.</p>
