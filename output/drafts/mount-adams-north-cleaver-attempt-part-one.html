      <h2>Hiked On</h2>
<p>6/24/2020</p>
<h2>Accessible Routes</h2>
<p>​   Having summited Mount Adams via the South route three times already I was well aware that there was at least one easy route up my backyard volcano. I didn't know however that a second 'easy' route existed until very recently. While perusing various peaks on SummitPost I discovered that a route on the North side of the mountain known as the North Cleaver was rated as class two just like the South route I had taken before.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08708.jpg"></p>
<p>​   While I'm no pro, it seems clear that climbing ratings are a guideline and not a rule. Even finding consistent definitions for alpine and climbing grades is a bit difficult, however, given that the south route up Mount Adams is also rated at class two I thought I had a pretty decent chance of successfully ascending the North Cleaver route.</p>
<h2>Getting Out the Door</h2>
<p>The North Cleaver route is typically accessed via the Killen Creek trailhead with parties often ascending the Killen Creek trail to High Camp where they stay the night and leave early in the morning for the summit. I decided to follow this plan and with the weather finally cooperating for a few days I loaded up my pack and set out for a lengthy drive.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08671.jpg"></p>
<p>Getting to the trailhead you leave the Columbia River Gorge behind to circle halfway around Mount Adams to it's remote northern side. After nearly two hours of lovely mountain views, deteriorating bridges, and muddy, pothole-filled gravel roads I arrived at the trailhead.</p>
<h2>Heading Into the Woods</h2>
<p>It was a weekday morning and after heading so far into the middle of nowhere I was surprised to see four other cars in the parking lot. My feeling of surprise shifted rapidly to dismay when I opened my door and was immediately swarmed by mosquitoes. Being the road had melted only melted out very recently swarming bugs hadn't even crossed my mind.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08672.jpg"></p>
<p>Despite momentary disbelief, I quickly accepted my buggy reality and tossed on my pack to get moving quickly in the hope of outrunning my new insect companions.</p>
<p>Based on the most recent reports I had read I was expecting to see snow covering the trail very early on and wasn't disappointed there. Large patches of snow began appearing around a half-mile in and the trail was snow-covered around one and a third miles in.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08683.jpg"></p>
<p>The bugs decreased noticeably with the appearance of deep snowpack and I slowed my pace to something more manageable. I lost the trail but managed to stay near it thanks to GPS maps and began to recognize landmarks from the only other time I hiked to high camp as a day trip.</p>
<h2>First Glimpses</h2>
<p>Most notably, after climbing slowly but steadily through endless forests of rather small fir trees the trail leveled out in a meadow and Mount Adams finally came into view. On this day the summit and much of the upper mountain was hidden by clouds but the immense Adams Glacier shone through and momentarily stopped me in my tracks. I marveled at the broken up blocks of ice and snow suspended on a steep slope thousands of feet above me.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08715.jpg"></p>
<p>That first glimpse of the mountain invigorated me and despite a growing weariness brought on by my heavy pack, I pushed forward eagerly. Past a familiar flowing creek and before long to the junction where the Killen Creek trail crosses the PCT.</p>
<p>The junction lies around three miles into the four-ish (4.24) mile hike and while the first three miles climb steadily it's the final push that is the steepest.</p>
<h2>Final Climb to High Camp</h2>
<p>After the junction of trails, there are a few more small hills to climb before you come to the final obstacle. After losing the trail once more and pressing myself through a small grove of fir trees I found myself at the base of the imposing final hill. On this day the face of the hill was fully snow-covered. To my left, I saw the partially exposed ridge that the trail usually winds it's way up.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08729.jpg"></p>
<p>I traversed in the direction of the ridge not wanting to stop to pull my ice axe off my pack nor navigate the steep face of the hill without it. After crossing a few islands of rock in the snowy expanse I soon made it to the ridge and continued making upward progress over loose rock and dirt.</p>
<p>Eventually, the melted ridge came to an end and I found myself back on snow. I had avoided the steepest snowy face by traversing left but still had to navigate a reasonably steep slope (~23°) whose runout lead directly to exposed rocks below. Fortunately, the afternoon was wearing on (4:00 pm) and the snow was quite soft.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08740.jpg"></p>
<p>Between the balance, my trekking poles added and the soft, forgiving snow it was no big deal to make my way across and up the snowy slope. Had the snow been hard-packed I likely would have wanted my ice axe in hand but sinking in several inches with every step left me feeling confident that I could arrest a fall in the case of an unexpected slip.</p>
<h2>Arrival</h2>
<p>I focused on my feet and continued with one step after another until the slope began to level out again. I had ascended the final obstacle and was greeted by the lightly sloping meadow that makes up High Camp. Islands of dirt and rock were melted out though the area was still largely snow-covered. I hiked across the first dirt patch and continued to the next one where I found a tent site protected by stubby fir trees from west winds and dropped my pack.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08743.jpg"></p>
<p>The view of the mountain was still largely obscured by clouds though they weren't low enough to have totally socked me in. This was my first trip out with any weight on my back in quite a while and I was beat. I set up my camp quickly and lay down in my tent for a brief rest. Forty minutes later I woke up feeling refreshed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08759.jpg"></p>
<p>My nap wasn't as brief as I had anticipated but I was pleased to awake feeling somewhat recovered. The fatigue I felt toward the end of my hike had me thinking I might not even try for the summit the next morning. After resting though my plan was back on track along with my excitement at having both reached high camp and put myself in good position for a summit push.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC08823.jpg"></p>
<p>By the time I got back out of my tent, the clouds had dissipated and I wandered around for an hour or so taking photos and trying to spot the route I planned to climb the next day. The ridge that makes up the North Cleaver is plainly obvious from High Camp though the way up it isn't. At least it wasn't to me. The ridge climbs rapidly and becomes narrower and more exposed as it does. High up I spotted what looked like cliffs and steep snow and from my vantage, I wondered how I would navigate them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="\media\images\2020\06\DSC09946.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a pleasant evening with a light breeze and comfortable temperature and for the time being, I tried to put my concerns out of my mind as I cooked dinner and settled in for the night.</p>
