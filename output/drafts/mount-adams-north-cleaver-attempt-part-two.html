      <h2>Hiked on</h2>
<p>6/25/2020</p>
<h2>Early Start</h2>
<p>I had settled in at High Camp on the North side of Mt.Adams and got to bed just after sunset. Now, I awoke to my alarm sounding at the early hour of four in the morning. I lay there considering whether or not to get up. This was my first hike in a long time with any real weight in my pack and by the time I arrived at High Camp the day before I was exhausted.</p>
<p><img alt="My humble camp at High Camp on the North side of Mount Adams." src="/media/images/2020/06/DSC08743.jpg"></p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later I was pulling on my pants, gathering the necessary bits of equipment strewn around my tent, and soon climbing climbing out to lace my boots. I set out just after four thirty marveling at the clear, cool morning and trying to pick out the route I would follow up the distant ridge.</p>
<h2>First Steps</h2>
<p>From my camp I headed southeast staying on the firm snow and breathing deeply as my legs and lungs warmed up. To the south lay a steep snow field which looked like the most direct route but I didn't want to put on my crampons so I headed instead a bit further East, to my left. I followed a previous set of footsteps up a less steep section of snow to crest the first small ridge on the way to the actual North Cleaver.</p>
<p><img alt="Mount Saint Helens peaking out in the early morning light." src="/media/images/2020/06/DSC08834.jpg"></p>
<p>Continuing on I slid down a small snow slope before transitioning to the rock and scree that would make up the most of the rest of the climb. I was an hour into the hike and would say I was now at the base of the actual ridge known as the North Cleaver. I could see the next thousand or so feet would be straightforward climbing, picking my way up and through broken rock toward what looked like impassable rock and snow still further above.</p>
<h2>The Lower Ridge</h2>
<p>In retrospect the route I followed was circumspect and a better alternative would have been to head directly up the first steep snow slope and around the right side of the icy lake hidden behind it. Instead, I went far around the left side of the lake and didn't see it until I was a couple hundred feet above it. This route worked fine but did add some distance.</p>
<p><img alt="An ice covered lake seen far below me with Mount Saint Helens behind it." src="/media/images/2020/06/DSC08855.jpg"></p>
<p>I climbed up the west facing slope still heading southeast until I crested the ridge and was able to see the glacier on its east side and out to the rolling desert hills far beyond. From there I stayed on top of the ridge as best I could and followed it south toward the steeper terrain I'd viewed from below.</p>

<p>As I gained elevation the ridge became sharper and the path narrower. Upward progress required careful navigation to avoid cliffs and excessively steep sections of scree.</p>
<h2>Snow Field</h2>
<p>Before long I arrived at the base of a snow field. Not a terribly long snow field but it was quite steep. Being early in the day the snow was still firm and after a moment of consideration I stopped to pull out my crampons and ice axe.</p>
<p>I had done a fair amount of travel on snow before though only with microspikes and now regretted not testing out my crampons in advance. I took one tentative step onto the snow and then another keeping my feet perpendicular to the slope, kicking in steps, and plunging the shaft of my ice axe deep into the snow.</p>
<p><img alt="The first snow field to be crossed. Tracks are visible on it, but they're all from goats..." src="/media/images/2020/06/DSC08889.jpg"></p>
<p>After the first fifty feet the slope became considerably more exposed angling so that a slip had the potential to result in an unrestrained fall of several hundred feet to the glacier on the east side of the ridge far below.</p>
<p>I continued, passing a stretch of flatter snow and lesser exposure where I caught my breath before continuing to the most exposed section where the snow field wrapped around to my left growing steeper again and putting me directly above the even steeper drop to down the eastern snow covered slope.</p>
<p>I carefully made my way around taking every step with care before crossing from snow back onto the rocky ridge.</p>
<h2>The Ridge Continues</h2>
<p>I felt uneasy at this point. I wasn't confident in my gear or my ability to self arrest on such a steep slope. Having such an obstacle between me and safety weighed on me. It was with this on my mind that I reached another steep snow field and had to stop to put my crampons back on.</p>
<p><img alt="Mountain goats seen far below" src="/media/images/2020/06/DSC08897.jpg"></p>
<p>This snowy area climbed up next to a short vertical rock face. The snow near the base of the rock face was mostly level creating a small shelf that was easier to walk on and I stayed on this shelf avoiding the steeper slope to my left that dropped all the way to the glacier below.</p>
<h2>Stymied</h2>
<p>I continued for maybe one hundred feet hugging the rock wall to my right and peering over the steep edge to my left before my path was blocked. The steep rock wrapped around directly in front of me and while it looked like it would be easy to scramble up I questioned whether I could repeat the process on the way down.</p>
<p><img alt="The spot I turned back at." src="/media/images/2020/06/DSC08909.jpg"></p>
<p>I looked out around the rock wall to my left and saw that if I stepped off the level snow shelf I could traverse around the rock and possibly find an easier way up. I weighed my options not relishing the idea of scrambling from snow to rock with crampons on nor stepping off the relative safety of the snow shelf into the exposure of steep forty plus degree snow.</p>

<p>With waning confidence and a descent that was only growing more challenging with every step up I chose instead to turn back and try again another day.</p>
<h2>Disappointment and Relief</h2>
<p>As always the descent went quickly. Soon I was back at the first snow field and after making my careful way down it I was flooded with disappointment and relief. I hate turning back from an objective but I know what my present abilities are and consoled myself with the fact that I had made the best decision for myself.</p>

<p>I took my time hiking back down, stopping often for photos and took a different route back to camp. I decided to stay another night even though it was still early in the day. I spent the day practicing self arrests in soft snow, exploring high camp, and dodging the swarms of mosquitoes before enjoying a glorious sunset and getting up early the next morning to hike back out.</p>
