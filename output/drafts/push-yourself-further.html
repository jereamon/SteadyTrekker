      <p>How hard are you supposed to push yourself? Really though, I don't know. I've set out on this mission of getting into the best shape I've ever been in, and based on some recent physical accomplishments, I think there's a good chance that I'm already there. But am I satisfied with that? Of course not.</p>
<p>My outlook is that the only people worth comparing yourself to are the absolute best in their field. This typically results in a large amount of disappointment, but as well, I believe it's the only way to continua<img class="alignright wp-image-226 size-medium" src="/images/article_images/2018/04/jordan-steranka-516295-unsplash-e1524686051185-270x300.jpg" alt="Mountain covered in clouds at sunrise" width="270" height="300" />lly improve in anything you're doing. I don't view the world this way simply from a competitive point of view. I'm not really competing with anyone but myself. But like other people I know, there is a drive to be better than average at anything deemed worthy of our focus.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm realistic about my expectations. I compare myself to the best and I realize how small of aÂ chance there is to equal them in any way. Nevertheless, that's the level I'm going to shoot for. It's the path to get there that is the fun part anyway. Once you've made it, you really only have one option. Start again. And I've always found getting started to be the hardest part.</p>
<p>All I'm trying to say is shoot for the highest peak, accept nothing less than the best from yourself, and know that when you're totally exhausted, mentally or physically, that you're probably on the right track. Just don't forget to take care of yourself along the way.</p>
