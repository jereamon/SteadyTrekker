      <p>It's April and the rain has caught up with us. It wasn't looking so bad this morning so we headed out for an earlyish ride in the fog and drizzle on the Syncline. It was all good. Nearly dry trails and no one out there. We were having fun tearing it up right until the bottom of the trail. My front wheel up and disappeared on a slippery rock and before I knew it I was headed over the bars.<img class="alignleft wp-image-40 size-medium" src="/images/article_images/2018/04/rainy-window-pane_925x-300x200.jpg" alt="Rain on a window pane." width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Wouldn't have been a big deal except for the rocks strewn about that I slid into with my hand and knee. I was back on my feet quickly but a few hours and a small amount of swelling have me limping around with pain even after four ibuprofen. What are you going to do though? It's going to happen eventually. I'm not quite complaining, but I am disappointed. With some wrecks you see it coming and have that split second to spring free from the mess of tangled metal your bike will shortly become. This wasn't one of those wrecks. I didn't see it coming and flailed hard as I went over the bars. I'll get back at that rock though. It's not going anywhere.</p>
