      <p>Going from Chukhung, at 15,518 feet up to Kongma La, at 18,136 feet would be no easy task with a full pack on. But having climbed higher than the pass when we ascended Chukhung Ri gave me confidence. As well, I had a motivated group to do it with. We planned to get started early, I don't remember what time we agreed on, but we made it out the door of our lodge a little before 7:00 am.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>We had heard it could take anywhere from six to twelve hours to make the crossing and didn't know where we would fall on that spectrum, hoping only to make it to Lobuche before dark. We began our day in a disorganized fashion, trying not to freeze while we figured out where we were going. Our lodge owner pointed out which way the trail headed out of town and we meandered in that direction, finding a bridge across the creek and a helpful sign pointing in the general direction of the pass.</p>

<p>We found the trail and got going in earnest. Before long we had to decide which way to head at a Y in the trail. Other groups were headed straight up the hill to our right, but, armed with maps on our phones Trevor and I confirmed the real trail continued straight ahead on a, fortunately, easier path. We meandered around the hillside headed more or less back towards Dingboche but slowly climbing instead of descending. Eventually, we were left with no choice but to head straight up a small valley next to an empty creek bed. We reached our first real climb of the day going up and out of the creek valley and made short work of it. Trevor, Connor, and I waited at the top for the others to catch up and when they did we laid out a plan for the day. The three of us were quite a bit quicker so we decided to stick together and get to Lobuche as early as we could in the hope of finding rooms. We had been told to expect to sleep on dining room floors while in Lobuche and Gorak Shep because both are so busy.</p>

<p>After a short rest, we continued on. The trail, for the time being, was actually quite easy. It skirted a hill and remained nearly flat for a couple of miles. We cruised along again marveling at the inhospitable, plantless landscape surrounding us and not for the first time I found myself wondering what I had gotten myself into. Of course, the trail didn't remain flat for long. We climbed a few small rises, took another break, and suddenly found ourselves at the base of a long climb.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>The trail took off up terrain that from a distance we couldn't see any route up. It zigzagged up and out of sight, apparently unending. Undeterred we got straight to it. The hill was massive and steep but it went by quickly in a blur of short breaths and dripping sweat. The views weren't actually that great yet, still being blocked by surrounding higher hills. I pushed my way up and over, making it, finally, to a point where the trail leveled out again.</p>

<p>I was tired, but not ready to stop yet. Continuing on I climbed over another small rise and on the other side found a small lake with four other people from our lodge resting near it. They had started over an hour before us but somehow already we had caught up. I was beginning to think that we might not actually take twelve hours to get across. Nurturing this hope, I only talked with them for a moment and then pressed on.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Another steep but short climb and suddenly I had a view of the top. It wasn't exactly close at this point. But closer than I had dared to hope. Cresting a couple more small hills and passing a large group on the way the trail lead me to a beautiful turquoise lake. By the time I reached its shores the pass was still high above me but didn't look that far away anymore. I could see that there was one more climb starting from the other side of the lake and heading right up to the prayer flags visible in the distance.</p>

<p>I made my way around the lake, moving slowly, taking photos. An encouraging sign painted on rocks along the way told me I was almost there but before the final climb, I had to take a rest. My legs were too tired to push on any longer without stopping. I found a comfy-looking rock and practically collapsed to the ground leaning against it and my pack, wondering how I would ever get up again.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I ate some snacks, drank some water, and looked around me, feeling dazed. It felt like I had sat there for ages and no time at all. I wanted to keep moving, to reach my goal, but couldn't motivate myself to stand up for at least a few more minutes. Eventually, I managed it. Pushing off the rock I leaned on and the ground I got to my feet, took a deep breath and headed for the top.</p>

<p>I passed a porter resting right at the start of the climb. I gave him a nod and a namaste and pushed myself up a short scree slope. After momentarily going straight up the hill the trail took a sharp left and turned into a sidehill trail with a steep drop to the lake on my left. I could see Trevor and Connor resting, nearly where I had. Presumably preparing themselves for the final push as well. I took deep breaths, one for every step, and focused on putting one foot in front of the other. There were occasionally high steps where I had to pause for a few breaths at before levering myself upwards. Without warning, I rounded a boulder, looked up from staring at my feet, and discovered the prayer flags I had seen from below were right in my face. I had reached the top without even realizing how close I was.</p>

<p>Relief flooded me, I dropped my backpack, took a few quick photos, and promptly sat down to munch on my summit snacks. Connor and Trevor reached the summit soon afterward. We congratulated each other and everyone else who reached the top while we were there. We were so excited to have made it but knew that our day was still far from over. We took one last look around, a few more bites of snacks, and picked up our bags to continue.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>From here Lobuche was visible and didn't even look that far away. We had heard tales of people getting lost on their way through the Khumbu Glacier but it barely appeared to be an obstacle from where we stood. Spirits high and energy restored from the successful summit we began scrambling down the descent.</p>

<figure><img class="size-large wp-image-1059" src="/images/article_images/2018/11/DSC02992-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Far, far above Lobuche and the Khumbu Glacier"/><figcaption>Far, far above Lobuche and the Khumbu Glacier</figcaption></figure>

<p>The climb down towards Lobuche is not an easy one. Ok, maybe easier going down than up. But still. We found ourselves climbing over and around boulders for far longer than I would have preferred. Eventually, we got off the rocks and back onto an actual trail again. My fear of broken ankles and helicopter rescues diminished slightly. The trail, however, heads nearly straight down the steep slope and is made up of small rocks and loose, dusty dirt. We slipped and slid, knees aching and continued making progress. It's hard to perceive scale when you're over 2000 feet above distant landmarks.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>The descent was dragging on far longer than I had expected. At the same time, our obstacles ahead grew. What had at first looked like a small rise to get into the glacier continued to gain height until I was able to make out a couple of people hiking up it and had the unfortunate realization that it was a two hundred foot high wall of dirt. The glacier itself had looked to be only a short distance across and reasonably flat. It was now becoming apparent that it was massive and pockmarked with lakes and craters some thirty feet deep.</p>

<p>We finally made our way to the bottom and took a break looking at the hill we knew we had to climb. An icy wind blew up the valley we sat in and that more than anything else got us up and moving again. Despite our weariness, we made short work of the hill and were soon looking directly into the glacier. Not much of a glacier at first glance. More of a moraine, considering no ice was visible. What we did see was startling. There were no flat places to follow a trail through. We would be going up and down the whole way, across rocks large and small, around impassable walls and lakes. We found a path marked by cairns and dove in, eager to be done with our ordeal. The trail wandered about and at times we lost it, having to look far ahead for the next small cairn.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before we came to an impasse. A cliff dropping off to a small creek flowing between two lakes. We found a boulder on the edge to use as a vantage point and scanned the ground below. We were able to spot stepping stones to cross the creek on and now just had to scramble down to them. A slightly roundabout way took us down to the creek and from below we got the first indication that we were actually on a glacier. The cliff we were now below was a massive wall of ice. Solid ice. I put my hand out to touch it, just to be sure. We wanted to look around a bit more but rocks and debris were being blown down on us from above. We hopped the rocks quickly and all made it across the creek without falling in.</p>

<p>Leaving our ice wall behind our crossing became monotonous. Climbing down into a crater-like hole just to climb back out over and over again. It wouldn't have been easy going even without everything else we had already done that day. It didn't feel as though I was actually walking anymore, merely falling forward. Somehow my legs continued to catch me before I fell on my face. We kept going like this for ages. Stumbling, grumbling, and stopping occasionally for photos of the new, alien landscape we found ourselves traversing. The massive wall marking the other side of the glacier grew closer. We traveled around the edge of a large lake and on the other side of it made it to the bottom of another steep climb. We could only hope it would be our last.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I don't remember if we took a break or just started climbing. Either way, we somehow made it up this climb too. I couldn't see Lobuche from the top of this climb and could only hope we were close. The trail leveled out and skirted the actual hilltop. We followed it along, as soon as we rounded the hill Lobuche came into view. Too weary to be excited we just kept walking. We dropped down the hill towards town and had a warm welcome as we happened to walk right downwind of a large burning trash pile. With the lingering scent of charred plastic in our nostrils, we crossed the final field, reaching town around 1:30 pm.</p>

<p>We headed into the first lodge we saw and asked about rooms. They had enough for our whole group, but the price seemed high. I dropped my pack and Connor and Trevor waited there while I ran around town to ask elsewhere. I quickly found better prices, but not nicer accommodations. Then, at one lodge, I was being shown a room and saw it had power outlets. The man showing me the room assured me they were functional. That sealed the deal.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I ran back, grabbed the other two, and we secured rooms for everyone. Of course, the first thing we did was try to plug in our phones, and of course, the outlets didn't work. I tried to talk to the guy about this to no avail. He claimed to have never said the outlets worked and that we could pay to charge our devices at their bakery next door. Frustrated and exhausted I sat down to consume as much dhal baht as I could for lunch. Determined to get my revenge by eating everything in their kitchen.</p>

<p>We spent our afternoon progressively getting more worried about the rest of our group. I climbed back up the hill to look into the glacier and sat there for an hour trying to catch a glimpse of them heading across. I could see people wandering about on the far edge, and partway across the glacier but couldn't recognize anyone from so far away.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I headed back to the lodge and played cards for a while with Connor and a couple of Nepali guys who were trekking to Everest base camp. It began to get dark, then actually got dark. We headed out again to walk around town and see if they were anywhere around, thinking at this point that they must have turned around somewhere and would be sending us a message any minute to let us know they were back in Chukhung.</p>

<p>We saw headlights bobbing into town and ran towards them shouting our friends' names. It turned out to not be our friends but another group who told us there were no others coming across behind them. Dejected we continued walking through town when suddenly someone called Connor's name. It was Kieran along with everyone else. They had made it into town a half-hour before and had just found their other friends at a nearby lodge.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Now overjoyed we gave hugs all around, gathered their gear, and all headed back to our lodge for celebratory dinner. Our celebrations were short-lived. Brought down by exhaustion and the knowledge that there was still Everest Base Camp, Kala Patar, and two more high passes to be climbed we headed to bed early. Intent on a long nights sleep.</p>
