      <p>After leaving Gorak Shep and splitting paths with Sanjey I had made my way to Dzonghla putting myself into position for the second of the high passes. I was lucky to still be accompanied by six other friends who planned to complete the passes as well. There was one small issue. My flight from Lukla seemed to be leaving a couple of days too early. I had reached out to my hotel manager who had booked my ticket originally to request that he change the date for me but hadn't received any clear response about whether it had been done. It was looking like I could make the flight I had originally booked but it meant no rest more rest days between now and then. Knowing it was at all feasible made me want to push myself and get there. I also would have liked to have had a couple of days of flexibility in case anything happened in between. I was already exhausted and not sure how difficult the following days would be.</p>

<p>For now, I had to focus on crossing the second high pass, Cho La. I assume the name has something to do with its proximity to the mountain Cholatse but I don't really know for sure. Regardless, it sits at 17,782 feet. Not as high as Khongma La had been but certainly still high enough to make things interesting. As well, I had been told that there were two glaciers to be crossed before making it to our final destination of Gokyo. One difference that makes Cho La somewhat easier than Khongma La is the village Dragnag that sits between Dzonghla and Gokyo. Somewhere to stop for lunch or even stay the night if you're weary enough by that point. This was all good to know, but first, there was a lot of climbing to do.</p>

<p>Our day started early again. The trail began climbing almost immediately out of Dzonghla. It wasn't long before our group was split up with everyone moving at a pace that worked for them. We switchbacked our way up and up initially on dirt but as the trail became steeper and steeper it began to turn into large rocks. Soon we were scrambling our way through a boulder field gaining elevation faster than ever. The change was enjoyable. I was getting pretty sick of just walking by this point in the trek and some good scrambling made for a fun morning. Albeit an exhausting one. Our scramble ended abruptly when the trail crested a ridge and reached a large flat space perfect for resting. The view looking back the way we had come was stunning. The sun had risen and looking back at Dzonghla, Chola Lake, and Cholatse took my breath away.</p>

<p>Trevor and I were hiking together at this point and after taking a few photos and grabbing some snacks we continued on. The first glacier came into sight quickly. This one was the real deal. A massive block of solid ice and snow. The trail skirted it on its left side remaining on the rocks and dirt for as long as possible before dropping us onto the slippery mass. We were lucky. In different conditions, the glacier could easily become impassible without traction devices. When we crossed though, the ice was ridged and grippy underfoot. There were smooth slippery patches but overall not too bad. Cho La turned out to be a very busy pass. There were quite a few people coming up with us and by the time we reached the glacier, there were many going down the other way too. We trudged on, doing our best to breath and not slip.</p>

<p>The top of the pass came into sight shortly after we got onto the glacier. It looked so close but still took a long time to reach. Walking on the ice, while not too treacherous, was slow going. We crept our way up it and eventually found our way back onto rock and dirt for the final scramble to the top. The last little bit felt the scariest by far. A short, but steep and exposed climb. There was plenty of space for our feet and ample handholds but between heavy packs and our distance from medical attention, it was just enough to get my adrenaline going. We made it though and tried to take in the views. A frigid wind blew over the pass and forced us to take shelter. We huddled in a slot between boulders and ate our snacks. I snapped a couple of photos and we continued on our way. The views from Cho La weren't as great as others we'd seen recently and we weren't willing to endure the icy wind for another minute.</p>

<p>The other side of the pass turned out to be a nearly endless set of stone steps. Difficult, but very much preferable to the rock garden we had to hop through while descending from Khongma La. We lost elevation very quickly, all the while watching a small rise in the trail ahead grow into a lengthy climb out of the valley we were descending into. At the bottom of our descent we got comfy for a minute, ate a bit more, and then moved on. Our legs had to switch gears, going from a long descent back to climbing was not easy. I already felt so worn out but managed to crawl my way up the hill. Even now, with the pass behind us, our day was far from over. I had no idea how much further there was to go but continued hoping 
the village of Dragnag wouldÂ appear shortly.</p>

<p>I was dismayed when I checked the map on my phone a ways down the trail and discovered Dragnag was still multiple miles and over 1000 feet of descent away. There's something wonderful and awful about putting yourself into a situation where the only way out is forward. I wanted nothing more than to curl up and sleep for a few days but the only available food and lodging resided miles down the trail ahead of me. With no other choice, I took some ibuprofen, picked myself up and pushed my body to continue performing. Trevor caught up to me and we made a couple of other friends on the way down to Dragnag. Cruising along as a group it wasn't long before the village came into sight. We stopped at the very first lodge in town for lunch, I laid down on a padded bench encircling the dining room and closed my eyes for a while, trying to prepare for the final push to Gokyo.</p>

<p>Out of Dragnag we went, now at the elevation of the Ngozumba Glacier, walking parallel to it until we had traveled far enough north to cross to Gokyo. Traveling that distance didn't take long on the flat trail and soon we found ourselves at the lip of another massive glacial moraine with nowhere to go but across. This crossing, fortunately, turned out to be easier. Well, in some ways. The trail wasn't difficult to find this time around but we still wound up, down, and around boulders and other obstacles for ages. Our second glacial adventure of the day finished with us walking around the left side of the steep bank of a large lake. A little close for comfort as we listened to ice cracking and saw pieces of the bank on the other side falling in. We made it around though and climbed our way up and out.</p>

<p>The rest of our hike was easy, thankfully. We continued on the now flat trail for a ways before rounding a corner where Gokyo finally came into sight. We first saw the huge turquoise lake and then the town sitting right on its banks. We headed down the last hill and began looking around town for a place to stay. We figured we would start with the lodge closest to the lake but had no luck there. Our search took us around town to several lodges until we wound up at EcoLodge Gokyo. Still a waterfront lodge but on the far side of town. As we were walking up to the lodge I snapped a photo of Trevor, the lodge, and Cho Oyu. Instead of safely clipping my camera onto my backpack as I had dozens of times before I dropped it straight onto rocks. It seemed to function fine initially, however, I later discovered that the autofocus motor was broken and the only way I could take pictures with it anymore was to focus manually. We tried to get separate rooms for ourselves, unsure where our friends were or if they would continue past Dragnag today, But the lodge manager wasn't having it. So we changed our tactic and asked if we could get rooms for everyone. They were fine with this but seemed skeptical of whether or not we really had any friends on the way.</p>

<p>Trevor and I headed upstairs to settle in and hope that if our friends didn't show up that we wouldn't be kicked out. I headed out to explore the town a bit and it was on my way back to the lodge that I spotted the first of our friends heading down the hill into town. We rejoiced and headed back to the lodge together, eager to be done with our day and make certain our rooms wouldn't be given away. Once everyone had arrived we fully settled in for the night with card games and copious amounts of food. Two out of three passes now complete and right where we needed to be for the third. First, a well-deserved rest day was in order. Well, a 'rest' day. The plan was to hike Gokyo Ri and then stay another night in Gokyo. A hike of about one mile each way with two thousand feet of elevation gain.</p>
