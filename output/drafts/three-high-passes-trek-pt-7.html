      <p>A 'restful' day spent in Namche Bazaar and it was time to continue on with our trek. Following the heavily trafficked trail out of town, the first thing we noticed was the elevation. The trail meandered along the hillside with a series of short climbs and descents and with every climb came rapid breathing and an excruciatingly slow pace. At 11,286 feet Namche still isn't high compared to where we were headed but the lack of oxygen was certainly apparent. A day spent wandering around the town without our heavy packs didn't seem to have helped us catch our breath at all today.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the trail starts relatively easily. At sea level, it would be a walk in the park and even at elevation, we made good time. Initially, the trail clings to the side of a steep hill climbing to around 11,700 feet over a couple of miles and maintains that elevation for another mile or so. It was on this stretch that we rounded a corner and caught our first glimpse of Ama Dablam. I had seen photos of Ama Dablam but the sight of it in person, even from so far away was breathtaking. There are a lot of mountains here but I don't think anything else quite compares to the unscalable beauty of this mountain. It is comparably quite low at only 22,349 feet but at first, or even fifth glance there is no apparent route up the sheer sides of this peak.</p>

<p>Our journey up the valley continued and as our views of Ama Dablam improved so did our views up the valley. We could see two villages in the distance and once we had determined which was Tengboche it quickly became apparent that we were, in fact, on the wrong side of the valley. The trail, visible in the distance, dropped down to a far off river and then made a rapid climb up the other side to the hilltop where the first buildings of Tengboche were visible. We had anticipated significant elevation change every day but it's a painful notion to drop so far just to climb back up.</p>

<p>We reached the village of Sanasa. From here you can split off and head West towards Gokyo or continue North towards Tengboche. Unfortunately for those of us continuing North, this is where the trail drops steeply. Losing about 1000 hard earned vertical feet down to the Dudh Kosi river. We rested for a moment at the bottom and let yaks cross the bridge. But once the elevation has been lost and the river crossed the only thing left to do is climb back up. So we before long we got back to trekking.</p>

<p>Even on weary legs I was still catching large groups left and right. From a distance, I had seen endless lines of people climbing toward Tengboche and I made the decision to get there as quickly as possible in an attempt to get us all decent rooms. Thus I began cruising past people, using porter trails where necessary and ignoring my burning legs and lungs. Near the village, there is a table where they sell tickets for rooms. You pay five hundred rupees and get a receipt that will get you a room at any lodge in town. Not the best price for accommodations but certainly not the worst either. The unfortunate part is that everything is still first come first serve. As such if you are lucky, or early, you can get a room in a very nice lodge. If like me, you aren't lucky, you get a room in a not so nice lodge and it costs exactly the same.</p>

<p>Niclas and I being the faster hikers ran around to the three lodges in Tengboche and our only option was to take a double room and a triple room and divvy up the beds. Sanjey and I were already used to sharing rooms, but Niclas and Ujjal had somehow managed to get single rooms up to this point. Not the end of the world, but not ideal either. It's certainly nice to have your own space to relax at the end of a long and tiring day. Anyways, we wound up at the Gomba Lodge. A place with a great view and the smallest rooms you've ever seen. Sanjey and I took the double room and found two narrow beds with maybe two feet of space between them. Just enough space to move around and organize gear but not exactly comfortable. We made do, dropped our bags and headed back out to soak in the views and get some food.</p>

<p>Many people are thrilled to make it to Tengboche to visit the monastery. Having already visited the monastery in Taksindu we instead spent our evening filling up on Dhal Baht, planning for the next days, and trying to remember the rules for card games. I taught the group how to play bullshit and we learned mau mau from Niclas. Simple games made funny and fun by the people we played with. Due to the lost days trekking from Phaplu Niclas' flight was coming up too quickly. He would have time to make it to base camp and back down only if he pressed on quickly and without any more days for rest or acclimatization. As such it looked like this would be our last night with the four of us all together. None of us were keen to stay another night in our subpar lodge but neither did we want to split up our group.</p>

<p>Eight o'clock rolled around and we drug our weary bodies to bed. It was here that I began to notice the elevation while trying to sleep. A restless night spent rolling back and forth was the last thing I needed but I had read about and expected nights like this and took what rest I could get.</p>
