      <p>For our first day in Dingboche an acclimatization hike was in order. I had read about hiking to the nearby Nangkartshang Hermitage and possibly higher to Nangkartshang Ri. The highest point we would be able to reach without having to rock climb. We had a hearty breakfast. I tried tsampa porridge for the first time. I'm told it's a Himalayan staple. Roasted barley flour mixed with hot water and butter to create a pasty substance. With an off-putting texture and lack of flavor, I decided to mix it with some muesli and copious amounts of sugar.</p>

<p>Our day started out difficult. Dingboche is already at 14,470 feet and we had a long way to climb through there. We had to head to the other end of town to actually start our hike and even walking the gradual incline of the main path left us breathless. Arriving at the other end of town we surveyed the map and our surroundings. The trail had to head more or less back the way we came to keep from getting too steep. From where we stood the ridge it eventually connected to didn't look like that long of a walk straight up the hill. We made the decision to go for it and set off on yak trails to head directly for the ridge. It quickly became apparent how much further away the ridge actually was but we're resilient and stayed the course, gaining elevation quickly, but moving slowly.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn't long before we got views of a homestead. I'm still unsure if it's the hermitage I read about but I don't know what else it would be. It looked like a nice place to visit but was far enough across the hillside to keep me from doing more than taking pictures and appreciating the tenacity of whoever built it when I did stop to rest. Despite the exhaustion creeping into my bones, my legs were feeling strong this day and I made fast work of the first climb. I lost sight of SanjeyÂ as the hill leveled out a bit and I reached the ridge where I connected to the main trail thirty minutes or so after we started.</p>

<p>The hill didn't remain level for long. I connected to the trail right where it turns steep and so after too short of a reprieve I was thrust straight back into the steep climbing. At this height, I had to focus intently on my breathing. My pace was slowing day by day. At this point, I was still managing two or three steps per long breath. I settled into a rhythm and covered a lot of ground in a fairly short time. Maybe forty minutes later I was running out of breath when I said hello to someone seated next to the trail. I wound up stopping for a while and met Tomas, a Canadian from BC who had begun his trek much earlier than any of us from the Eastern side of Nepal in a village I believe is called Taplejung. He had spent the last couple of weeks hiking through endless jungle, staying in people's homes, and had planned to hike from there all the way to Pokhara. Originally his plan would have taken him through Lukla but not up to Everest Base Camp. He changed those plans and was now on his way there. Also climbing Nangkartshang to aid in the acclimatization process.</p>

<p>It was nice to run into someone else from close to home and we talked for a while before I continued. In case you were wondering getting going again is by far the hardest part. I think this applies at low elevation but becomes even more apparent up high. Your heart races, trying to catch up as you struggle for breath and your legs burn. Every part of you wants nothing more to stop again. To just lay down for a while and get lower. But then, miraculously, if you push through the discomfort, you can find a rhythm where your breathing sort of does catch up, and before you know it your legs aren't burning, and even though you still want to stop, somehow it gets easier to keep going. It's not really possible to hike fast once you're this high but if you can hike steadily, continually, you'll leave people behind, and maybe feel better in the process than stopping and starting repeatedly.</p>

<p>Regardless, I still had a lot of ground to cover. I couldn't see a definite summit yet and for the time being the hill appeared to climb upwards forever. I put my head down and covered ground. The reality was better than I expected. Another twenty-five minutes of hiking and I had a view of the top. Prayer flags blowing in the wind and someone who had already reached it with their arms in the air. Ecstatic, I tried to spur myself to greater motion. I made it a few steps at a faster pace before I was heaving for breath and reconciled myself to my slower, maintainable pace. Maybe thirty more minutes and I made it. There's no single summit block, especially since it's not a real summit, just the highest point before the real climbing begins. I made my way through some final rocks, under a huge string of prayer flags, stepped up onto a rock at the top, and balked when I looked down and saw nothing but open air for at least five hundred feet below my toes.</p>

<p>I had unwittingly stepped right up to the edge of a cliff that overlooks the valley that heads further up to Chukkung and Island Peak and back down on Dingboche and the valley we had ascended. Having just climbed to 16,600 feet I was still catching my breath and wasn't entirely steady on my feet. I did my best not to fall off the edge or look foolish in front of the other people sitting nearby. I backed away from the edge a couple of steps and sat down to take it all in. The views were fantastic, we had clear skies that day and since I had yet to become desensitized to the snowcapped peaks surrounding me I sat for a while in awe. I saw others approaching and quickly took a few photos of the views and myself before the summit became crowded.</p>

<p>It turned out to be Tomas, a few other Canadians, and an American named Trevor. They were all close to my age, had similar interests, and planned to hike the three high passes as well. Though on a slightly different timeline. The Canadians' friend was on her way to summit island peak while they made their way up to meet her in Chukkung. We all chatted for a bit and it wasn't long before Sanjey arrived as well. I hadn't seen him when I turned to look behind me on the final stretches and had feared that he wouldn't make it to the top. </p>

<p>His original plan had been to hike to Everest Base Camp and hadn't known of the several side trips that were part of my itinerary until he met me. He still wasn't sure at this point whether he would do any of the passes and this hike was an important test for him to help decide whether he would continue with me. To say the least, I was excited to see him come over the final ridge and reach the summit, taking this as a sign of his resilience and hopefully meaning I wouldn't have to part ways with my good friend just yet.</p>

<p>The descent seemed to go on for longer than it should have. The way up had somehow felt shorter than the way down. Before too long though we made it back to Dingboche. It was still reasonably early and we had seen a cafe on our way through town that would be showing a movie that afternoon for people like us spending the day acclimating. We headed there for lunch and found nearly every seat taken in anticipation of the afternoon film. We ordered lunch and found seats. The veg burgers we ordered turned out to be delicious and the movie, called Sherpa was a documentary about the Sherpa's who make climbing Mount Everest possible. Fitting for where we were and interesting to find out more about the people working 'behind the scenes' to aid the climbers who get all the glory for their achievements.</p>

<p>Another afternoon well spent. Afterward, we headed back to our lodge to chill for a bit and when we went to the dining room discovered Tomas was staying at our lodge too. We sat with him that night and got to know him better over dinner. It was nice to have someone else to converse with and Sanjey and I learned quite a bit about Canadian tree planting that evening. Unfortunately, we would be heading off the main route to Chukkung the next day while Tomas continued towards Lobuche and Everest Base Camp so it was unlikely we would meet again. The night wore on and we said goodnight and goodbye, mentally preparing ourselves to put our big packs back on the next morning.</p>
