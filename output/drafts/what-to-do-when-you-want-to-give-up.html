      <p>What are you supposed to do when you want to quit working towards a goal you've expended an enormous amount of time and effort on? Probably just quit, or write about it. You never know it might help.</p>
<p>I don't actually have any idea what you should do. But I've found myself in a position where I've put a ton of time towards a somewhat vague goal. We're talking months and hundreds of hours. And I have very little physically to show for it.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-674 aligncenter" src="/images/article_images/2018/05/animals-deep-ocean-deep-sea-130621-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>It's all knowledge and computer files. I haven't met a bunch of people and ingratiated myself in a community or produced any fantastic work to hang on the wall.</p>
<p>After all my effort I have almost no ties to my craft. And I want to quit, just give up and forget I ever started. I don't know where to go next, I don't know who to ask, and it's starting to feel like I'm wasting my time. Like it has all been a waste of time.</p>
<p>So I'm hoping that writing about it here will help me analyze the whole situation and maybe reinvigorate my desire to push through the burnout to new heights of productivity. We'll see.</p>
<p>What I know for sure, is that I've put in too much effort to stop. Whether I take a break, or focus on something else for a while I know there's no going back. In the meantime I'll be watching <a href="https://youtu.be/LooArXcqW4I?t=212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Sonmez</a> and listening to <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S-Town</a>.</p>
