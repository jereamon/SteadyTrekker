      <p>Geez, I sure am having a hard time keeping pace with my blog posting. Somehow it always seems to slip my mind despite being written on my whiteboard right next to my computer. It's strange how progress on some goals can be so easy to maintain while others feel near impossible.</p>
<p>This one in particular isn't a difficult goal. It doesn't take much time, physical strain, or even mental effort. But somehow I'm having a hard time completing it to a degree I'm satisfied with. A large part of that stems from my attempts to spend less time on the computer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-730" src="/images/article_images/2018/07/franck-v-647073-unsplash.jpg" width="5184" height="3677" data-temp-aztec-id="f2844b7f-a574-4bf7-852b-23c79e159fb4"></p>
<p>I burnt myself out pretty thoroughly in my pursuit to learn programming and web development. I don't want to give up on either, but i sure needed a break. They're as interesting as they are tedious and frustrating. After months of six hour days in front of the screen melting my brain with challenging problems something had to give.</p>
<p>Suddenly summer rolled in and that combined with my desire to explore the outdoors and get away from my computer was more than enough for me to feel justified in taking a break that could stretch several months.</p>
<p>I do feel bad about not continuing the progress I fought so hard to make. But I can only hope that coming back with a fresh perspective and motivation to learn will allow me to set clearer goals and actually begin to make my mark in a lucrative field.</p>
<p>In the meantime I'll do my best to keep up with my blog posts, journal entries, book reading challenge, exercise regime, summit bids, and bike tours. Despite trying to narrow down my hobbies I'm still spread thin and I like it that way.</p>
