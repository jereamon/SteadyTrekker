<p>post_title: Wind Mountain Hike</p>
<hr>
<p>Wow, February here in the Gorge has been surprisingly nice. I had seen decent weather in the forecast but didn't really believe it so I only decided to go do this hike the morning of when I looked out the window and saw clear skies.</p>
<p><img alt="Trailhead sign" src="/media/images/2020/02/DSC08347.jpg"></p>
<p>This has been one of my favorite hikes for quite some time. It's only around twenty five minutes from my house, is short and low enough to be done year round, and provides some of the best views of the Gorge I've seen. I've sat at the top of Wind Mountain upwards of ten times now but it never gets old staring out over Home Valley, Carson, and Stevenson from the cliffy shale covered peak.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08354.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A mossy log." /></p>
<p>The parking area is non-descript and located a short ways from the actual trailhead but it has been found out by Portland area hikers and seems to be busier every time I get out there. There were a few cars there when arrived but I headed down the road where I knew there were a couple of additional spots to park right at the trailhead and managed to squeeze into one of them.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08351.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Wooded mossy trail." /></p>
<p>A wooden sign post marks the start of the trail and had been decorated with some wonderful chimes since I had last been there. With the sublime sound of chimes ringing in the breeze behind me I set off into the forest of massive second growth fir trees and thick moss.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08359.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A big root in the trail to use as a step." /></p>
<p>The trail clings to the side of a steep slope and slowly climbs up and around Wind Mountain taking you from the mountain's northwest side to it's southeast side only for the trail to double back on itself to reach the top.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08361.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A small bridge built into the hillside." /></p>
<p>Along the way there's a turnoff to one of my favorite spots. The turnoff is blocked by a log and probably shouldn't be used, but I decided to head down to the intact outcropping of stone it leads down to one more time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08371.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Standing on the edge of a cliff!" /></p>
<p>This turnoff is steep and has some moderate exposure but after navigating a short way down the hill levels out onto a level block of stone with sheer cliffs on all sides and a wonderful view of the neighboring Dog Mountain and the Columbia River.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08374.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Same cliff, different view." /></p>
<p>There used to be some bolts for rock climbing or rappelling here but on this visit it appeared the hangers had been removed. Regardless, I took a short rest and enjoyed the solitude and sunny winter day before continuing the climb.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08397.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Another couple hiking through a scree field." /></p>
<p>The rest of the trail continues upward over a few logs and through a couple of talus fields before breaking reaching the tree covered peak of Wind Mountain. It's not that long of a hike, but you still have to work for your view at the top. The tall trees at the top of the mountain make a full three hundred sixty degree view impossible.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC08409.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Looking out over the Columbia River through some trees at the top of the mountain." /></p>
<p>Two viewpoints provide separate views with one looking east and the other west. Both are spectacular and easily accessible, though the footing does become tricky as any clear area is composed of large and precarious rocks to navigate. Amongst these rocks it's not hard to find a nice seat with a backrest at which to rest a moment. That is, if the wind isn't blowing you half off the mountain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/article_images/2020/02/DSC04354.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Looking East from Wind Mountain." /></p>
<p>As the name suggests this short peak is consistently windy. This is where the separate overlooks become a good thing. The wind in the gorge is virtually always blowing either from the west or from the east. This means that if it's blustery and frigid on one side of wind mountain's summit, there's a good chance the other side is considerably calmer.</p>

<p>On this day in February it happened to be sunny and reasonably calm. I decided to spend some time at the top and set up my camera for a time lapse. I put on all my layers and hunkered down while my camera clicked away alternating between reading, admiring the view, and doing laps around the summit loop for warmth. Roughly two hours later I was rewarded with a series of pictures that resulted in this.</p>

It was worth the wait, I think, but I can't help wishing I had brought a wider angle lens to capture a bit more of this panoramic view.

Anyways, as much as I hate the possibility of driving any additional traffic to this hike it's one I'm enamored with enough to want to share my photos and experience of. That and according to my newly installed site analytics, I'm the only visitor to my website. So there's little to worry about as far as this post convincing any additional Portland residents to make the drive out to this splendid little mountain.
