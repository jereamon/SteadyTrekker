<p>post_title: Basic Supplies for Winter Hiking</p>
<hr>
<p>Getting outside in the winter requires a different mindset than for summer outings. Obviously, right? But if you want to get out there and you're wondering what specifically will keep you alive, at least during daylight and assuming you don't put yourself directly in the path of an avalanche then here's the basic gear you'll want to bring along.</p>
<h2>Clothes</h2>
<p>Clothes, on clothes, on clothes. If you've lived in the Pacific Northwest for a single winter you'll know they're wet. Your best friend will be synthetic clothing. It's light, insulates whether wet or dry, and dries quickly. Though don't expect to ever dry out once you're wet, oh and do expect to get wet. There's no way around it if it's raining or snowing and you're doing anything strenuous. The more waterproof your wet weather gear, the less breathable it will be. In other words, the more water you keep out of your jacket the more moisture it will keep in. </p>
<p>Anyways, these are the layers you'll want to have. What you actually wear will depend on a variety of factors including air temperature, wind speed, whether it's raining, and the difficulty of the hike you're taking on. Determining what to have on your body to keep yourself comfortable is something you will have to learn over time. However, my recommendation is to stop often to put on and take off layers. It's hard to warm up once you're cold and harder to stay warm when you stop if you are soaked in sweat. Frequent clothing adjustments will add time to the hike but will keep you in better condition in case of emergency or just to enjoy your time outside.</p>
<p>Well, that turned into a tangent. Ok, recommended layers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Base Layer Top and Bottom (long underwear). Something like: 
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Underwear-Sports-Compression-Workout/dp/B07VPBQZ9Z/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=base%2Blayer&qid=1578975049&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExVDE0Q09aTjYxVTkyJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjc3ODc1MjlOMkxJQkI1RDVUTCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzA2Mjk3NjhVQTNGTUVDMDA5JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1&psc=1">Random Base Layer</a><br />As the link says, that's just a random top and bottom set I found, I don't know that those specifically are any good, but they are synthetic fabric and inexpensive!
    </li>
    <li>Lightweight middle top layer (For this and the next I mean something like a fleece jacket)</li>
    <li>Heavier-weight middle top layer (Heavy fleece or just a second light fleece, or a down jacket) <br />Down jackets are certainly acceptable on dry days but if you're headed out into downpour and your down jacket gets soaked through the down will compress and no longer provide the warmth you're expecting.</li>
    <li>Insulated bottom layer (Fleece pants) Only if it's really cold, not something I've needed.</li>
    <li>2 Beanies. I don't like hiking with a hood unless it's real cold so I let one beanie get soaked while I'm moving and keep a spare for when I'm stopped.</li>
    <li>Thin gloves and thick gloves. Something light like a glove liner is great for strenuous uphill hiking.</li>
    <li>Thick socks on your feet and a spare pair. Merino wool is great, all synthetic is fine too, but no cotton socks!</li>
    <li>Regular pants, again synthetic. Not a necessity if you'll be in snow pants the whole time but they add a small amount of additional insulation and mean you can more comfortably remove those snowpants if conditions change.</li>
    <li>Snowpants/Rain pants</li>
    <li>Waterproof breathable shell (uninsulated jacket) You'll want something with pit zips! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sherpa-Lithang-Jacket-Rathee-Antiquebrass/dp/B01GTQBJRG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SOXR1U2UEG9V&dchild=1&keywords=sherpa+lithang+jacket&qid=1580748860&sprefix=sherpa+lith%2Caps%2C274&sr=8-1">I'm wearing this at the moment and it works well for me.</a></li>
    <li>T-shirt, again, synthetic</li>
    <li>Sunglasses or goggles. I'm not covering anything for mountain climbing here, but If your hike will consist of long periods on snow with the sun out you may want to invest in some sunglasses with <a href="https://www.julbo.com/en_us/sunglasses/shield#216=459&318=2457" >a bit more protection</a> than the average pair.</li>
    <li>Neck gaiter or full balaclava or both!</li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned when I got to sunglasses, I'm not covering gear for mountain climbing in this post nor avalanche safety gear. With that in mind, beyond the extra clothing you'll need for hiking in the winter the rest of the supplies you would carry are the same as those you would have in summer. First aid kit, food, water, navigation essentials. I won't <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html">go into all that</a> here.</p>
<h2>Traction Devices</h2>
<p>Beyond that the other winter essential to have are Shoe traction devices. These don't have to be full on crampons, but hiking on compacted snow or ice without any added traction is a recipe for disaster. <a href="https://kahtoola.com/product/microspikes/">Microspikes</a> have become very popular and work fantastically. </p>
<p>Depending on your hike you can probably <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICEtrekkers-6060-P-Shoe-Chains/dp/B00S16Z2EE">get away with less</a> but I'll leave the judgement of which to bring up to you. </p>
<p>I'm not really here to sell microspikes, but they have taken me up Mt.Adams multiple times successfully; not on blue ice, but over compact snow up 30-ish degree slopes. In case you were wondering how much use they really are.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Beyond loads of clothes and traction devices take the gear you would for summer, keep a close eye on the forecast, and when possible go with friends rather than solo. But it's the 21st century and no one has friends anymore so just get out there and don't blame me if you get yourself into trouble.</p>
