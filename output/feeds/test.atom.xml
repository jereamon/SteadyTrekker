&lt;p&gt;It has been quite some time but I've finally gotten around to making a new website on which to post my musings and keep track of the outdoor adventures I go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been quite some time but I've finally gotten around to making a new website on which to post my musings and keep track of the outdoor adventures I go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone wondering, I've decided to build this site using the Python based static site generator Pelican. That means I don't have to deal with backend programming and can focus on frontend development and writing. Better yet I can easily write my posts using Markdown syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if none of that makes sense to you don't worry. It doesn't really matter. My plan for this site is still to post the photos I take and write about the places I visit. Not talk about the technical details of my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now this is all. But hopefully I'll be back with more soon!
I plan to bring the posts from my old website to this one over time but it's a tedious process to change the file paths for all the images so we'll see when I get around to that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Test"></category></entry></feed>
