<p>In the middle of June 2022 I decided to tag along on a cycling trip my aunt had planned, and my parents were going to participate in. Their plan was to ride both the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes and the Route of the Hiawatha in northern Idaho.</p>
<p><img alt="Trusty dog companion rides along in a basket on the back of a bike." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04381.jpg"></p>
<h1>Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes Intro</h1>
<p>The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes is an old railroad grade that has since been converted for recreational use and does not allow motorized vehicles. It does allow e-bikes though. It is seventy-three miles long and paved the entire way. And while it does require you to cross active roads, but it never shares any road. It crosses most of the state from west to east. It starts in Plummer, Idaho near the southern tip of Lake Coeur d'Alene (it's Chatcolet Lake down there though they're connected) and eventually heads north-east meet and follow I-90 through the historic town of Wallace and on a bit further to end in the town of Mullan.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04384.jpg" alt="A pomeranian named Rambo sits in a basket on the back of a bike." />
    <figcaption>Ok, last dog photo I swear.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes never gets steep. I believe it averages around two percent grade the whole way, with the steepest section from Plummer down to Lake Coeur d'Alene being around three percent grade. Between the four of us, we took three mountain bikes and a cruiser bike with a dog in a basket on the back. Something with road tires would be preferred and recommended for this trail. There are some stretches of bumpy pavement, but certainly not enough to justify a full on mountain bike if you have something else.</p>
<h1>Route of the Hiawatha Intro</h1>
<p>The reason we brought our mountain bikes though was for the Route of the Hiawatha. This is another old railroad grade that has been converted for recreational use, but unlike the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes is not paved.</p>
<p>Though unpaved, the trail still maintains an easy grade, around two percent as well, and boasts seven high trestles and eight tunnels. Each vary in height and length, but the longest tunnel is 1.66 miles long and requires warm clothes and adequate lights. The trail is operated by the Lookout Pass ski area, thought the trail does not start from the ski area. There are a few different places to get on the trail and different ways you can go about riding it. We found it difficult to communicate with Lookout Pass, so I'll do my best to detail the options below.</p>
<p><img alt="Lovely wildflowers in bloom." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04436.jpg"></p>
<p>Again, on this trail we took our three mountain bikes and the cruiser bike but, since no pets are allowed on this trail, the dog had to be left behind. To elaborate, no pets in any capacity are allowed whether walking on their own or in baskets, trailers, or backpacks. In this case, those of us with the backpacks were glad to have them. The trail is mostly graveled, though with bare dirt stretches and some sections are very bumpy. We all survived, but wider mountain bike tires and suspension were nice to have.</p>
<h1>Our Campsites</h1>
<p>The campgrounds we stayed at were:
- Heyburn State Park -- Around five miles east of Plummer.
- By The Way Campground -- In Pinehurst, Idaho, just off I-90.
- Wallace RV Park -- Just north of Wallace, Idaho.</p>
<p>Each campground offered power and water, and Wallace RV Park had full hookups. I believe By The Way offers full hookups as well, but the site we were in did not have them. Heyburn was wooded and very near to Chatcolet Lake, but still had quite a bit of road noise from the nearby highway five and the big trucks going back and forth for construction taking place. The other two were RV parks and offered little natural shade, though By The Way has a nice gazebo space to take refuge under on hot days.</p>

<h1>Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes in Depth</h1>
<p><a href="https://visitnorthidaho.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CDA_map3-26-21_updated.pdf" target="_blank">I would recommend this map</a>. It is the one we used and the one I'll refer to for mileages, trailheads, and stops. We found paper copies either at Heyburn State Park or the Plummer trailhead. I can't remember which.</p>
<p>The way we wound up riding the trail may have been a bit unorthodox, but it worked well for us. Our original plan was to get picked up and dropped off at various points by our fifth member who wasn't riding. This would have let us ride the trail all in one direction. In the end though, we did each day as an out and back. This meant far less driving, and we got to ride the entire trail in both directions.</p>
<p><img alt="Riding along Chatcolet lake with the Chatcolet Lake Bridge in view in the distance." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04407.jpg"></p>
<h2>Riding Sections</h2>
<p>These are the sections we broke the trail up into. They worked well since we were riding each section both ways. We only had to drive to Bull Run from Pinehurst but every other day we rode from where we camped. We did the last two sections in the same day with a break in between.</p>
<p>And here's a link to the same map I recommended above but with each section we did highlighted in alternating shades of purple:</p>

<p><br></p>
<h2>Heyburn to Plummer and Back</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 6 to 0. ~6 miles one way</strong></p>
<p>Our first day was a short one. This was also the steepest section of trail though, so we thought it would be a good way to kick things off and make sure our bikes and legs were working.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04388.jpg" alt="A concrete monument in Idaho with flags flying above." />

</figure>

<p>We rode from our campsites at Heyburn and took the road through the state park to the trailhead at trail mile six. From there it was a continuous but gentle climb through a forest recovering from a fire alongside a beautiful creek. There were two bathrooms available along this stretch and before long we had climbed out of the woods to flat pavement and the outskirts of the town of Plummer.</p>
<p>The trailhead at Plummer is very nice with a large parking lot, bathroom, and bike tools. Oh, right, and the giant statue and monument!</p>

    <figcaption>And the statue in Plummer.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After a break we headed back down enjoying the easy peddling and coasting now that we were going downhill.</p>
<h2>Heyburn to Springston (through Harrison)</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 6 to 18.3. ~12.3 miles one way</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Crossing Chatcolet Lake Bridge on a bike." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04413.jpg"></p>
<p>We got on the trail at trail mile six again and headed in the opposite direction. And this is a beautiful stretch of trail. There's a mile or two at the start, where you're cruising through the trees and alongside Chatcolet Lake. And then you arrive at, what I considered to be, the highlight of this section, Chatcolet Lake Bridge. It gets high off the water, giving you great views of the lake in all directions and offers a fun descent after you've had your fill and taken your photos.</p>
<p><img alt="Riding bikes along Lake Coeur d'Alene." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04426.jpg"></p>
<p>The rest of this section is beautiful too. It stays lakeside until you reach Harrison where I highly recommend stopping for ice cream, coffee, sandwiches, or whatever your stomach desires. Ice cream for sure though. Beyond Harrison the trail heads east and gets into marshy terrain that is beautiful in its own right and fantastic for seeing wildlife like herons and moose.</p>
<p><img alt="A friendly turtle suns itself on a rock." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04428.jpg"></p>
<h2>Bull Run to Springston</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 33.5 to 18.3. ~15.2 miles one way</strong></p>
<p>Between the last section and this one we moved campsites. It took around an hour to drive from Heyburn State Park up through Coeur d'Alene to By The Way Campground in Pinehurst. From there it was around a twenty-minute drive back to the Bull Run Trailhead.</p>
<p><img alt="A wild moose in a marshy meadow." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04459.jpg"></p>
<p>I'm going to say this about almost every section. But this one was beautiful as well. You ride along the Coeur d'Alene river for a ways before getting back to marsh land. We managed to start early enough (maybe 8:30 or 9:00) to see several moose, heron, and hear the ruckus caused by a pond full of frogs croaking.</p>
<p><img alt="A lovely bend in the Coeur d'Alene River." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04463.jpg"></p>
<p>Much of this section did feel repetitive though too with long straights through the marshes and a headwind that made our return challenging.</p>
<h2>Pine Creek (Pinehurst) to Bull Run</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 48.7 to 33.5. ~15.2 miles one way.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="One of many beautiful river views." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04497.jpg"></p>
<p>Ok, this section was my personal favorite. There are long stretches that feel far from roads and follow right along the Coeur d'Alene river. The hills surrounding the trail have closed in more than previous stretches and are growing steeper, but the trail grade remains consistent. We were lucky to spot a couple of bald eagles soaring, and an owl perched in a tree, and had many excuses to step off our bikes and admire the views thanks to plentiful benches and gorgeous bends in the river.</p>
<p><img alt="Another lovely view of the Coeur d'Alene River." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04517.jpg"></p>
<p>If the weather is hot when you're there (close to 100° in the afternoon the day we did it) then Pine Creek is a wonderful place to cool off. You cross it right at the trailhead and it is very cold! There are many other places along this trail where swimming is not recommended due to high levels of dangerous metals that leached into the water from the mining operations and tailings left behind. I don't know whether this is a safe spot to swim in that regard but we did and don't seem to have any more brain damage than we did before swimming.</p>
<p><img alt="A heron sitting on a tree branch" src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04528.jpg"></p>
<h2>Pine Creek (Pinehurst) to Shont (Big Creek)</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 48.7 to 60.4. ~11.7 miles one way</strong></p>
<p>The Shont (Big Creek) trailhead is the one just across the freeway from the Sunshine Mine Memorial.</p>
<p>This stretch still held some beautiful views and we saw more moose on this stretch than anywhere else. But east of Pinehurst the trail stays closer to I-90 and you pass through Smelterville and Kellogg on the way to the trailhead at trail mile 60.4. All are interesting towns with remarkable history, I just prefer isolated nature when I can get it!</p>

    <figcaption>The gazebo at By The Way Campground.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Aside from nature there were interesting things to see too. Including informative signs discussing the history of mining operations in the area, Silver Mountain Resort, and the Sunshine Mine Memorial which is worth riding over to see.</p>
<p>This stretch of trail also goes right past the CDA Bike Co. in Kellogg and a Walmart Supercenter in Smelterville if you're in need of any bike parts or snacks.</p>
<h2>Wallace to Shont (Big Creek) and Back</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 64.6 to 57.4. ~7.2 miles one way</strong></p>
<p>We moved campsites again between the last section and this one from By The Way in Pinehurst to the Wallace RV Park just north of Wallace. We didn't spend that much time exploring the other towns along the way but wandered all over Wallace. Every town in this region has an abundance of history associated with it and Wallace is no different. In fact, the entire town is on the National Historic Register. Just take a look online at the various museums in town and stories about the town, and you'll likely want to visit yourself.</p>
<p>This stretch of trail as well stays close to I-90 and it kind of has to since by this point the surrounding mountains are becoming quite steep. Despite that, riding through the town of Osburn makes for interesting scenery and there's Gene Day Park at the western edge of town that makes for a nice place to stop for a while.</p>
<h2>Wallace to Mullan and Back</h2>
<p><strong>Trail mile 64.6 to 71.4. ~6.8 miles one way</strong></p>
<p>The last stretch on The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes! Riding under the overpass that towers above Wallace might have been my favorite part of this stretch. On this section there are brief parts where you're right alongside I-90 but fortunately most of it keeps its distance and at least puts some trees between you and the busy freeway.</p>
<p><img alt="A wild moose on the trail and too close for comfort." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04566.jpg"></p>
<p>Despite the proximity to the road there are still beautiful views on this section as well. You follow the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River for a long ways and no matter how you've broken up the trail reaching its end in Mullan is something of a relief.</p>
<p>Best of luck and have fun if you decide to tackle this gorgeous trail across Idaho! Oh and stay far away from the moose!</p>

<h1>Route of the Hiawatha in Depth</h1>
<p>So, I covered some of the details for this trail above. What else do you need to know? We found it to be difficult to get the information we wanted when calling Lookout Pass Ski Resort so I'll try to fill you in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ridethehiawatha.com/trail-maps">This links to the map I'll be referencing for trail locations.</a></p>
<p><img alt="Entering a tunnel on the Route of the Hiawatha." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04581.jpg"></p>
<h3>General Info</h3>
<p>As I said above, Lookout Pass manages and operates this trail. There is a fee to ride the trail and they offer a shuttle so that you can do the trail from the top down and get a ride back up. The prices may have changed but I believe the trail fee was $15 per person (on a weekday) when we rode it. We stopped and purchased our passes at the Lookout Pass resort which is on the way to the East Portal trailhead if you're headed there from Wallace. I believe you can purchase passes and rental bikes at the trailhead but am still not certain of this since we didn't so check for yourself before you go!</p>
<p><img alt="In the middle of a tunnel that is short enough to see through." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04583.jpg"></p>
<h3>Typical Route</h3>
<p>The way I believe most people do the trail is to park at the East Portal, ride the full length of the trail down to Pearson, take the shuttle back to Roland, and the ride back through the very long tunnel (Taft Tunnel [St. Paul Pass]).</p>
<p><img alt="Riding across an old train trestle high above the ground." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04586.jpg"></p>
<h3>East Portal Parking lot</h3>
<p>Look up and download directions before leaving as we did not have cell service out there! But in short,  if you're traveling eastbound on I-90 then shortly after crossing into Montana take exit five. Take a right at the end of the exit ramp, then head left onto the unlabeled Randolph Creek road. You'll then take the first available right and stay right onto Rainy Creek Rd 506. You follow Rainy Creek Rd 506 until turning off it to the left onto what Google Maps labels East Portal Rd where you'll arrive at the parking lot.</p>
<p><img alt="Looking back across an expansive valley at train trestles I had already ridden across." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04601.jpg"></p>
<h3>The Way We Did It</h3>
<p>We didn't want to take the shuttle and were hoping to ride from the bottom up to have the descent on our way back to our car. We also had a dog that would have to be left in the car and we didn't want to leave him alone for too long.</p>
<p>Lookout Pass tried to steer us toward doing the trail in the standard fashion I described above and couldn't tell us whether we could drive from the East Portal to Pearson at the other end of the trail. As can be seen on the map, there is a section of trail that is on forest road 506 (described as Rainy Creek Rd 506 above). We had no idea if this section was still open to motor vehicles or not. </p>
<p><img alt="Looking further down the same valley as the last photo two more trestles are visible." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04606.jpg"></p>
<p>So our plan was to drive past the East Portal to Roland, where the shuttles return to. Ride from there through the long tunnel to the East Portal and back to check on the dog before doing the rest of the ride from Roland to Pearson and back.</p>
<p>What actually happened was, we drove past the East Portal parking area and found the road to be open and in use when we made it to Roland. So, we decided to keep driving. It is a long drive down a windy gravel road but we were able to get all the way to Pearson without difficulty. Do note that there is not a lot of parking down at the Pearson end. My guesstimate would be room for ten cars. It depends on whether people are parked there with trailers and things!</p>
<p>So, in the end, we rode from the bottom up and then all the way back down and it was great! </p>
<p>And after doing so we drove out forest road 456 back to Wallace which was in fine shape though time consuming since it's another windy and long gravel road. Check first since I don't know for sure if you can buy passes at the Pearson trailhead. But if that is possible you could simply go from Wallace to the Pearson trailhead using forest road 456. I don't know if this is really any faster than driving past the East Portal to Pearson or not so map it and make your own decisions! I'm only going to tell you it's an option. </p>
<p><img alt="A high train trestle that, for once, had no people on it." src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04607.jpg"></p>
<h2>The Trail</h2>
<p>This trail gets very busy. Hundreds if not thousands of people were out there pedaling on a sunny summer Thursday. Regardless, the views are stunning, there are loads of interesting informative signs and crossing the trestles and riding through the long tunnels make for a ride like no other.</p>
<p>Do be prepared for the long Taft Tunnel. It's wet and cold in there and it goes on for a long, long ways. You'll want warm layers for that section even if it's a hot day outside. As well, you'll want (they're required) bike lights so you can see where you're riding, and I would recommend taking another flashlight/headlamp so that you can look around the tunnel wherever you please. It's an interesting place! Just do your best not to blind other approaching riders.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/article_images/2022/06/DSC04609.jpg" alt="A crowd of people looking at a waterfall on the western end of Taft Tunnel." />
    <figcaption>A small taste of the crowds of people on the trail that day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And, I don't know if it's always this way. But be prepared for a long wait if you're taking the shuttle back up. I pedaled ahead of my group to free our dog from the car sooner and the lines at the bottom were ridiculously long.</p>
<p>And finally, as with any ride, I would recommend bringing the basic tools to work on your bike if necessary. There are 'trail marshalls' who patrol the trail and I believe they will help you with basic repairs in a pinch but carrying what you need is the only sure way to save yourself a long walk if your bike implodes.</p>
<p>And again, have fun and good luck if you decide to tackle this trail! It's one I'll never forget.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This was a fantastic trip! We worked hard and had a lot of fun. I had never seen a moose in person before this and am now terrified of their majestic and ungainly speed and power. If you get a chance to ride either of these trails I would highly recommend you take it.</p>
